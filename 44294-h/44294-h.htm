<br />THE SHIP&rsquo;S GHOST</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Flo&mdash;Florence! They saw me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little French girl, Petite Jeanne,
sprang noiselessly through the cabin door.
Then, as if to keep someone out, closed the
door and propped herself against it. &ldquo;They
saw me!&rdquo; she repeated in a whisper. &ldquo;And
they&mdash;I believe they thought me a ghost. I&rsquo;m
sure it was so. I heard one of them, he said
&lsquo;ghost.&rsquo; I heard him!&rdquo; Jeanne clasped and
unclasped her slender fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who saw you?&rdquo; Florence stared at her
through the dim light of the moon that came
straying through the narrow window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Who saw you?&rdquo; came from somewhere
above them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The men.&rdquo; Jeanne was growing calmer.
&ldquo;There were two of them. They saw me.
They had tied their boat to the wreck. They
were going to do something. I am sure of
that. Then they saw me and acted very much
afraid. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>do</i> look like a ghost,&rdquo; Florence broke
in. &ldquo;In that white dressing gown with your
golden hair flying in the moonlight, you look
just like a ghost. And I suppose you popped
right up out of the hatch like a ghost!&rdquo; She
laughed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these men&mdash;&rdquo; her tone sobered. &ldquo;What
were they doing here at this time of the
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; said Jeanne. &ldquo;How is one to know?
They rattle chains. They see me, then Old
Dizzy lets out one of his terrible screams, and
they are gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Closing her eyes, the little French girl saw
all that had happened just as if it were being
played before her as a drama. She saw dark
waters of night, a golden moon, distant shores
of an island, black and haunting and, strangest,
most mysterious of all, the prow of a
great ship rearing itself far above the surface
of Lake Superior&rsquo;s waters.</p>
<p>The ship was a wreck, you would have said
a deserted wreck. And yet, even as you said
it, you might have felt the hair rise at the back
of your neck, for, appearing apparently
through the solid deck, a white apparition
rose at the prow. Rising higher and higher,
it stood at last a wavering ghost-like figure
in that eery moonlight. This was her own
figure Jeanne was seeing now. Once again,
with eyes closed, she seemed to stand there
in her wavy gown of filmy white, bathed in
the golden moonlight. Once again she looked
at the glory of the night, the moon, the stars,
the black waters, the distant, mysterious
shores where no one lived.</p>
<p>The distant shore line was that of Isle Royale
fifteen miles off the shore of Canada, in
Lake Superior.</p>
<p>All this was a grand and glorious dream to
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>They had been here three days, she and
Florence Huyler, whom you may have met
before, and Greta Clara Bronson, whom you
are going to love as Petite Jeanne, who had
known her for but two months, loved her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; Jeanne had whispered to herself,
standing there in the moonlight, &ldquo;we are
going ashore, ashore on that Mystic Isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashore? One would have said she must be
standing on a ship lying at anchor. This was
not true. The old <i>Pilgrim</i>, a three hundred foot
pleasure boat, would never sail again. Fast
on the rocks, her stern beneath the black
waters, her prow high in air, she would rest
there a while until&mdash;ah, well, until, who could
say what or when?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the little French girl had whispered,
&ldquo;is our summer home.&rdquo; How the thought had
thrilled her! Three girls, the &ldquo;last passengers,&rdquo;
they had styled themselves, three girls
alone on a great wrecked ship for long summer
months.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>What fun it had been to fit out the captain&rsquo;s
and the first mate&rsquo;s cabins&mdash;what fun and
what work! Bunks had been leveled, chairs
and tables fitted with two short and two long
legs to fit the slanting floors, a score of adjustments
had been made. But now they were
all done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tomorrow,&rdquo; she had repeated in a
whisper, &ldquo;tomorrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was that? Had she caught a
sound? Yes, there it was again, like the purring
of a cat, only louder. It came from the
dark waters of night. Listening, intent, motionless,
she had failed to fathom its meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something on shore,&rdquo; she had tried to assure
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashore.&rdquo; At once her keen young mind
was busy conjuring up fantastic pictures of
those shores which, though so near, scarcely
a half mile away, were utterly strange to her.
Wild moose, wandering about like cattle;
wolves, tawny gray streaks in the forest; high
ridges; great boulders laden with precious
green stones; and in the silent waters of narrow
bays such monstrous fishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>But again her mind was caught and held
by that strange sound, a very faint put-put-put.</p>
<p>Even as she listened the sound ceased.
Then of a sudden she felt a thud that shook
the wrecked ship. At the same instant she
made out a dark bulk that was, she felt sure,
some form of a craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; she thought with a shudder. &ldquo;Men
coming to the wreck in the night! I wonder
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was frightened, dreadfully afraid. She
wanted to escape, to drop through the hatch-way,
to go where her friends were in the cabin
below. Her feet would not move. So there
she stood, white-faced, tossing gold-white
hair, waving white robe, a pale ghost in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>What did the men on that boat think of
her? Of course there were men, two of them,
on the deck of that small, black power boat.
For the moment they did not see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are they here?&rdquo; Jeanne asked herself.
&ldquo;What will they do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>This indeed was a problem. The ship had
been relieved of her cargo, all but a few barrels
of oil in the hold that could not be reached.
Even the brass fittings had been removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing they could want,&rdquo; she
assured herself, &ldquo;absolutely nothing. And
yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was gifted with a most vivid imagination.
This old ship had sailed the seas for
more than forty years. What unlawful deeds
might not have been done within this grim
old hull! There had been smuggling, no doubt
of that. The ship had visited the ports of
Canada a thousand times. What secret treasure
might still be hidden within this hopeless
hulk? She shuddered at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we want,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;is peace,
peace and an opportunity to explore that most
beautiful island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to say, the little French girl was
not the only person who at that moment felt
a cold chill run up his spine. One of the men,
the tall one on the little schooner, had caught
sight of a patch of wavering white far up on
the prow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mart!&rdquo; he was saying to his companion,
and there was fear in his voice, &ldquo;Do you think
anyone ever died on this old ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Why not?&rdquo; His companion&rsquo;s
voice was gruff. &ldquo;What do you think? She&rsquo;s
sailed the lakes for forty years, this old <i>Pilgrim</i>
has, and why wouldn&rsquo;t people die on her, same
as they die on other ships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; the other man&rsquo;s words came with
a little shudder, &ldquo;then it was a lady that died,
for look! Yonder in the prow is her ghost a-hoverin&rsquo;
still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man looked at the drifting, swaying
figure all in white, and he too began to
sway. It seemed he might drop.</p>
<p>Seeming to collect his strength with great
effort, he seized the line that held his own
tiny craft to the wrecked ship, then grasping
a pike pole, was prepared to give it a mighty
shove that would send it far out.</p>
<p>At this very moment a strange and terrible
sound smote the air; a wild scream, a shrill
laugh, all in one it rent the still night air
three times, then all was still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>The man with the pike pole shuddered from
head to foot. Then, regaining control of his
senses, he gave a mighty heave that set his
small craft quite free of the apparently haunted
ship.</p>
<p>The boat had not gone far when a curious
animate thing that seemed neither man nor
beast burst from the narrow cabin. The thing
began roaring and dancing about the deck like
a baboon attacked by hornets. On the creature&rsquo;s
shoulders was something four times the
size of a man&rsquo;s head. The upright body was
quite as strange as the head. As the boat continued
its course the great round head rolled
off and a smaller one appeared. This small
head bobbed about and roared prodigiously,
but all to no purpose. The little black boat
had moved straight on to pass at last from
sight into the night.</p>
<p>Then, and not until then, did the wisp of
white, which, as you know, was Petite Jeanne,
glide forward and vanish. She burst excitedly
into a dark cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard chains rattle,&rdquo; Jeanne repeated,
standing still in the cabin doorway. &ldquo;One of
the men spoke. They looked up at me. I
wanted to run, but I couldn&rsquo;t. My&mdash;my feet
wouldn&rsquo;t budge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began dancing around the small cabin
in her excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo; Florence, a large,
ruddy-cheeked girl in knickers, demanded.
&ldquo;What did they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;why, it was queer! They seemed in
an awful hurry. They untied their boat and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought,
&ldquo;there was Dizzy. He let out a most terrible
scream, and laughed. How he did scream and
laugh! Three times&mdash;one, two, three. They
shoved off, those men did, as if their very life
depended on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were a ghost,&rdquo; Florence
chuckled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be any question about that.
Who&rsquo;d blame them? Look at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Jeanne went on, &ldquo;then some
queer thing with two legs came out and
danced wildly about the deck. He had an enormous
head. Bye and bye his head tumbled
off, at least the awful big part, and I heard
him roaring at the other men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was a man in a diving rig. He&rsquo;d
taken off the helmet. Now, what do you think
of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite out of breath, the blonde haired little
French girl dropped down upon a berth at the
side of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man in a diving suit.&rdquo; Florence spoke in a
matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;Going to dive, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Why?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s brow
wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; she said slowly after a period of
silence, &ldquo;wish they hadn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was to wish this many times in the days
that were to follow. And then she was to
change her mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />MYSTERIES OF NIGHT</h2>
<p>As Florence and Jeanne sat there in the
dark, whispering and wondering about
the strange black schooner and its purpose in
these waters, wondering too whether they
dared light a candle and heat water for tea,
something moved in the berth above their
heads, and they became once more conscious
of the third member of their party, Greta
Clara Bronson.</p>
<p>You have been wondering perhaps how it
came about that Jeanne and Florence, who
spent so much of their time in great cities,
were to be found living on this wreck off the
primeval shores of Isle Royale. You will find
the answer in the third girl, Greta Clara Bronson,
who now slid her bare feet over the edge
of the berth and prepared to descend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Greta was slender, rather tall, with black
hair, snapping black eyes, and a body that
was a fine example of perpetual motion. At
this moment she was recovering from an attack
of hay fever and asthma. That is why
she was here, why they were all here. Isle
Royale is a rare retreat for hay fever victims.</p>
<p>Two months before Jeanne had met Greta
and had fallen in love with her. Greta could
dance almost as well as Jeanne. She played
the violin &ldquo;divinely,&rdquo; as Jeanne expressed it.
So when, one midsummer day, Jeanne found
her friend sitting up in bed panting for breath,
and was told that only a summer on Isle Royale
could bring back to her the joy of life, she
had hurried away to find Florence. Together
they had plotted and planned. And now, here
they were.</p>
<p>But why on a wrecked ship? Are there no
hotels on the island? Yes, there are four small
hotels on Isle Royale. But what trio of happy,
energetic, adventure-loving girls would choose
a hotel rather than the deck of a wrecked ship
for a summer outing? Some might, but not
Florence, Greta, and Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>The only fear, expressed by them a half
hour later over their tea, was that some unforeseen
event might drive them from their
strange retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s afraid?&rdquo; Florence swung her stout
arms wide. And who indeed could be, with
Florence as her protector? Strong as a man,
a physical director and a gymnast, tipping the
scale at one hundred and sixty pounds, she
could swim a mile, row a boat through tireless
hours, and handle a gun with the best of
men. Nor was the gun lacking, a short, business-like
rifle hung above her berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that you&rsquo;ll ever need it,&rdquo; Swen Petersen,
a fine young fisherman who had loaned
it to her, had said. &ldquo;All us fisher folks are
simple and honest. And you&rsquo;re not allowed to
shoot animals on the Island. It&rsquo;s a game preserve.
But you will like to look at my rifle
sometimes.&rdquo; So he had left it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Florence smiled as she recalled his words.
She was enjoying &ldquo;looking at it&rdquo; this very
moment. More than once she had taken it
down to handle it lovingly. Once, on seeing a
bit of wood bobbing in the water, she had taken
aim and fired. The short, stout rifle had a
great roar to it. And Florence had a steady
aim; she had split the wood in two, first shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;I
wish people would not prowl around the boat
at night. And what would one dive for?&rdquo; she
asked herself. &ldquo;Three or four barrels of oil in
the hold&mdash;surely they are not worth all that
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it struck her all of a heap that here
was a mystery and perhaps some great secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this broken hulk of a ship hide some
rich treasure?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>She laughed the thought down, but it
bobbed up like a cork in water, more buoyant
than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s ghost is gone!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
springing up. &ldquo;I wonder if those men will
come back. I&rsquo;m going to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave us here?&rdquo; Greta, too, was on
her feet. Youngest of the trio, she was unaccustomed
to wild, out-of-the-way places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; Florence invited. &ldquo;No ghost
costumes though! Get into your long coats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later three dark shadows stole
out upon the slanting deck of the wrecked
ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; Greta gripped Florence&rsquo;s stout arm.
&ldquo;How spooky it all is in the moonlight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just think!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered.
&ldquo;Thousands of people have walked this deck,
thousands upon thousands! The ship&rsquo;s more
than forty years old. Thousands of those passengers
will never walk any deck again. They
are gone from this world forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh! Jeanne, don&rsquo;t talk like that!&rdquo;
dark-eyed Greta implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s your black schooner?&rdquo; Florence
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone for good, I guess,&rdquo; Jeanne said after
scanning the dark waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For good?&rdquo; Florence murmured. &ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>For a full half hour they marched arm in
arm up and down the broad deck. During all
that time not a dozen words were spoken. It
was a time for thought, not for speech. Here
they were, three girls alone on the deck of a
wrecked ship. They hoped to make it their
summer home. Were intruders to bring all
this to an end?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it!&rdquo; Florence told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swen told us we would not be disturbed,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;No one lives near. The Tobin&rsquo;s
Harbor settlement is five miles away. Blake&rsquo;s
Point with its rugged reefs and wild waves
lies between. Few small crafts pass that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;tomorrow
we will row over to Duncan&rsquo;s Bay.
Perhaps we shall find some trace of the black
schooner there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, for many long moments she
gave herself over to contemplation of the
scene of wild beauty that lay before her. The
golden moon, dark waters, a shore line that
was like a ghostly shadow, the wink and blink
of a distant lighthouse, all this seemed a picture
taken down from an art museum wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she said at last, giving two slender
arms a squeeze. &ldquo;Come, we must go in.
Tomorrow is another day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />A PHANTOM OF THE AIR</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a phantom, a phantom of the air!&rdquo;
Body aquiver, her black eyes reflecting
the light of the setting sun, Greta stood intent,
listening with all her ears.</p>
<p>A moment before she had been hearing only
the goodnight song and twitter of birds.
Strange sounds they were to her. Bird songs
all the same. But now this. &ldquo;It is celestial
music from heaven!&rdquo; she whispered. Yet as
she thought it, she knew that was not true.
A musician herself, she had recognized at
once the notes of a violin.</p>
<p>The sound came from afar. At times a light
breeze carried it quite away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be miles away. In this still air sound
carries far. But where can that one be who
plays so divinely?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>To this question she could find no answer.
She was standing on a narrow, natural platform
of stone. Before her, almost straight
down two hundred feet, were the black waters
of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay. Miles away, with ridges,
tangled jungles and deep ravines between,
was the nearest settlement.</p>
<p>She had climbed all the way up Greenstone
Ridge from the shore of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay that
she might be alone, that she might think. She
was not thinking now. She was listening to
such music as one is seldom privileged to
hear.</p>
<p>Yes, she had climbed all that way through
the bush that she might think. Greta was an
only child. This was her first long journey
away from home and mother. Tears had stood
in her mother&rsquo;s eyes as she bade her goodby,
yet she had said bravely enough, &ldquo;You must
go, Greta. The doctor says you will escape
from the poison of ragweed. I cannot come
with you. You will be safe and happy with
Jeanne and Florence. Goodby, and God bless
you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>There were times when this dark-eyed child
recalled those words, when great waves of
longing swept over her, when her shoulders
drooped and all her body was aquiver. At
such times as these she wanted nothing so
much as to be alone.</p>
<p>As she had stepped into the still shadows
of the evergreen forest at the back of the
camping ground on Duncan&rsquo;s Bay that afternoon,
she had been caught in such a wave of
homesickness as would seem for the moment
must sweep away her very soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; she had called, and there was
despair in her heart. &ldquo;Florence, I am going
to climb the ridge. You and Jeanne go on. I
have my flashlight. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be back after the
sun has set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Florence had called cheerfully.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go over the ridge. If you do you&rsquo;ll get
lost. Keep on this side. If you lose your way,
just come down to the water&rsquo;s edge and call.
We&rsquo;ll hear you and come for you in the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the slim black-eyed girl had
breathed. &ldquo;Oh, how good it will be to be alone&mdash;to
watch the sun set over the black waters
and to know that the same sun is making long
shadows in our own back yard at home,
and perhaps playing hide and seek in mother&rsquo;s
hair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her face toward the rocky ridge
that towered above her and whispered to herself
once more, &ldquo;Alone, all alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, though no one is known
to inhabit Greenstone Ridge, and surely no
one at that hour would be found wandering
there so far from the regular haunts of men,
she had experienced from the first a feeling
that on that ridge she was not quite alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;I know I am not
alone up here. There is someone else somewhere.
But who can that person be? And
where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Here indeed was a mystery. For the moment
however, no mystery could hold her attention.
Even thoughts of mother and the
sunset were forgotten. It was enough to stand
there, head bare, face all alight, listening to
that matchless melody.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>As Florence had pushed her stout little boat
off the sandy shore that afternoon, she had
been tempted to call Greta back. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;
she said to Jeanne, &ldquo;we have made a mistake
in allowing her to lose herself in that forest
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can harm her?&rdquo; Jeanne had reasoned.
&ldquo;Wolves are cowards. The wild moose
will not come near her. There is no one on
the ridge. It will do her good to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus reassured, Florence had straightened
the line on her pole, hooked a lure to a bar on
her reel, and, with Jeanne in the stern of the
boat, had rowed away.</p>
<p>Someone had told Florence that the waters
of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay were haunted by great dark
fish with rows of teeth sharp as a shark&rsquo;s.
From that time the big girl had experienced
a compelling desire to try her hand at catching
these monsters. Now she breathed a sigh
of suppressed excitement as she unwound a
fathom of line from her reel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do it this way,&rdquo; she said to Jeanne.
Her whole being was filled with a sort of
calm excitement. &ldquo;Cousin Joe told me just
how you fish for pike. You put this red and
white spoon with its four-pointed hook on the
line. Then you let the line out, almost all of
it, a hundred and thirty feet. Then you row
around in curves. You drag that red and
white spoon after the boat. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne nodded. &ldquo;And&mdash;and what happens
then?&rdquo; She had caught a little of the big girl&rsquo;s
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then of course the fish takes the
spoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does he want with the spoon?&rdquo;
Jeanne&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks&mdash;&rdquo; Florence hesitated, &ldquo;well,
maybe he thinks it&rsquo;s a herring or a perch. Perhaps
red makes him mad. He&rsquo;s a wolf, this
pike is, the wolf of all dark waters. He eats
the other fish. He&mdash;but come on!&rdquo; her voice
changed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going. Be dark before
long. You let out the line while I row.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>For some time after that, only the thump-thump
of oars and the click of the reel disturbed
the Sabbath-like stillness of that black
bay, where the primeval forest meets the dark
water at its banks and only wild creatures
have their homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost all
out.&rdquo; She sat in the back seat and, lips parted,
pulse throbbing, waited.</p>
<p>They circled the dark pool. The sun sank
behind the fringe of evergreens. A bottle-green
shadow fell across the waters. They
circled it again. A giant dragon fly coursed
through the sky. From afar came the shrill
laugh of a loon. A deep sigh rose from nowhere
to pass over the waters. A ripple
coursed across the glassy surface. And then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! Stop! We&rsquo;ve hit something!
The line! It&rsquo;s burning my fingers!&rdquo; Jeanne
was wild with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Give it to me!&rdquo; Florence sprang up,
all but overturning the boat. Gripping the
rod, she reeled in frantically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fish!&rdquo;
Her words came short and quick. &ldquo;I&mdash;I feel
him flapping his tail. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s coming. Must
have half the line. Here&mdash;here he comes. Two&mdash;two-thirds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! There he goes!&rdquo; The reel
screamed. In her wild effort to regain control,
Florence felt her knuckles bruised and barked,
but she persisted. Not ten feet of line remained
on the reel when the fish reluctantly
halted in his wild flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s hooked fair!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;And
the line is stout, stout as a cowboy&rsquo;s lariat.
We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get him! We&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again her splendid muscles worked in
perfect time as she reeled in yard after yard
of the stout line.</p>
<p>This time she fancied she caught a glimpse
of a dark shadow in the water before a second
mad rush all but tore rod and reel from her
grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! Let the old thing go!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s
tone was sober, almost pleading. &ldquo;Think
what a monster he must he! Might be a sea-horse
or&mdash;or a crocodile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Florence, laughing grimly, &ldquo;is
Michigan, not Florida. There are no alligators
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Once again she had the fish under control
and was reeling in with a fierce and savage
delight. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming. Got to come. Now!
Now! Now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />CAPTIVATING PHANTOM</h2>
<p>The music to which Greta listened was
unfamiliar. &ldquo;Is it a song?&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;or an evening prayer? Who can have written
it? Perhaps no one. It may have come
direct from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not believe it. Someone was playing
that violin. Real fingers touched those
strings. She longed to search them out, to
come before that mysterious person of great
enchantment and whisper, &ldquo;Teach me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah yes, but which way should she go? Already
the shades of night were falling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she cried as the music ended.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop! Go on, please go on!&rdquo; It was as
if the phantom violin were at her very side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>The music did not go on, at least not at
once. Emerging from its spell as one wakes
from a dream, she became once more conscious
of the goodnight song of birds, the dull
put-put-put of a distant motor, the cold black
rocks beneath her feet, the dark waters far
below where some object, probably Florence
and Jeanne in the boat, moved slowly forward.</p>
<p>And then her lips parted, her eyes shone,
for the phantom had resumed his song of the
strings.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In strange contrast to all this, Florence
continued her battle with the big fish. In this
struggle she was meeting with uncertain fortune.
Now she had him, and now he was
gone. She reeled in frantically, only to lose
her grip on the reel and to see her catch disappear
in a swirl of foam. At last, when her
muscles ached from the strain, the fish appeared
to give up and come in quite readily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There! There he is!&rdquo; Jeanne all but fell
from the boat when she caught one good look
at the monster. He was fearsome beyond belief,
a great head like that of a wolf, two rows
of gleaming teeth, a pair of small, snake-like
eyes. And, to complete the picture at that moment
over the bottle-green waters a long ripple
ran like a long green serpent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Let go! It&rsquo;s a
snake! A forty-foot long snake!&rdquo; The slight
little girl hid her eyes in her hands.</p>
<p>No need for this appeal. In a wild whirl of
foam the thing was gone again. But still fastened
to his bone-like jaw was the three-barbed
hook. And the line, as Florence had
said, was &ldquo;stout as a cowboy&rsquo;s lariat.&rdquo; She
had him. Did she want him? Who, at that
moment, could tell?</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at that moment one of
those thoughts that come to us all uninvited,
entered the big girl&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;What did that
diver on the black boat want on our wreck?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>No answer to this disturbing question entered
her mind. They had left the ship unguarded.
They had come to Duncan&rsquo;s Bay
prepared to stay at least for the night. That
they would stay she knew well, for the wind
was rising again. To face those dark, turbulent
waters at night would be perilous. &ldquo;What
may happen to the ship while we are gone?&rdquo;
she asked herself. Again, no answer.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The melody, faint, coming from afar, indistinct
yet unbelievably beautiful, having
reached Greta&rsquo;s ears once more and entered
into her very soul, she stood as before, entranced,
while the light faded. She was, however,
thinking hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can it be, that violin?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Where indeed? On that end of Isle Royale
there are two small settlements. To reach the
nearest one from that spot would require
three hours of struggling through bushes,
down precipices and over bogs. The traveler
would be doing very well indeed if he did not
completely lose his way in the bargain. It was
unthinkable that any skilled violinist would
undertake such a journey only that he might
fling his glorious music to the empty air about
the Greenstone Ridge. It was even more unthinkable
that anyone could have taken up his
abode somewhere among the crags of that
ridge. On Isle Royale there are summer homes
only along the shore line, and there are very
few of these. The three hundred and more
square miles of the island are for the most
part as wild and uninhabited as they must
have been before the coming of Columbus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a phantom!&rdquo; Greta whispered, &ldquo;A
phantom of the air, a phantom violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she willed it strongly enough, she
might have gone racing away in fear. She did
not will it. The music was too divine for that.
It held her charmed.</p>
<p>What piece was it the mysterious one
played? She did not know or care; enough
that it was played. So she stood there drinking
it in while twilight faded into night. Only
once had she heard such music. In a crowded
hall a young musician had stood up and, all
unaccompanied, had played like that.</p>
<p>Could it be he? &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;It cannot be. He is far, far away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Then a thought all but fantastic entered her
mind. &ldquo;Perhaps I have radio-perfect ears.&rdquo;
She had heard of people, read of them in some
magazine, she believed, whose ears were so
attuned to certain radio sounds that they
could receive messages, listen to music with
their unassisted ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has never been so before,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;Yet I never before have been in a place of
perfect peace and silence.&rdquo; The thought
pleased her.</p>
<p>And then, as it had begun, the marvelous
music died away into silence.</p>
<p>For ten minutes the girl stood motionless.
Then, seeming to awake with a shudder to
the darkness all about her, she snapped on her
flashlight and went racing over the narrow
moose trail leading away to the distant camping
grounds of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />PALE GREEN LIGHT</h2>
<p>The little drama, in which Florence and
Jeanne played major roles, continued.</p>
<p>Duncan&rsquo;s Bay is primeval. Not an abandoned
shack marks its shores, not a tree has
been cut down. When darkness &ldquo;falls from
the wings of night&rdquo; this bottle-green bay, reflecting
the trees, shut in by the gloom of the
forest, casts a spell over every soul who
chooses to linger there.</p>
<p>It is a solitary spot. Six miles away, around
a wind-blown, wave-washed point there are
human habitations, none nearer. Little wonder,
then, that the frail, blond-haired Jeanne
should renew her pleading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence, let that thing go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;thing&rdquo; of course was a living creature
caught on Florence&rsquo;s hook at the end of the
stout line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeanne,&rdquo; the big girl remonstrated, &ldquo;I
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> let him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the line!&rdquo; Jeanne was insistent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cost two dollars. And that red and white
spoon cost another dollar. Shall I throw three
dollars into the lake?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Florence began reeling in once
more, &ldquo;the thing&rsquo;s a fish, not a snake. There
are no boa constrictors in America. He&rsquo;s just
a big, old northern pike. Looks like a snake,
that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bring him in,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;You
just take a good look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reeled in fast. The fish, at last weary
of battle, came in without a struggle and, for
one full moment lay there upon the surface of
the water. A magnificent specimen of his
kind, he must have measured close to four
feet from tip to tail. His eyes and cruel teeth
gave him a savage look, but in that failing
light his sleek, mottled sides were truly beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf of the waters,&rdquo; Florence murmured.
&ldquo;Truly you do not deserve to live! If a herring,
gorgeous flash of silver, passes your way,
there is a mad swirl and his favorite pool
knows him no more. The beautiful speckled
trout and the perch fare no better. Even little
baby ducklings that sport about on the surface
are not safe from your cruel jaws. A
swirl, a frantic quack, qua-a-ack, and he is
gone forever. And yet,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;who am
I that I should set myself up as a judge of
wild life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; Jeanne pleaded, &ldquo;let him go!
What do we want with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Come to think of it, we couldn&rsquo;t
really make much use of him.&rdquo; Florence
laughed a merry laugh. &ldquo;Must weigh twenty
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you put him in the boat he might
bite you,&rdquo; Jeanne argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or break a leg with his tail.&rdquo; Florence
laughed once more.</p>
<p>She flipped the line. The red and white
spoon shot to right and left. She did it again.
The fish turned. A third time the spoon rattled.
There was a swirl of white waters, then
darkness closed in upon the spot where the
fish had been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Jeanne gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I gave him his freedom.&rdquo; Florence
lifted the red and white spoon from the water
to send it rattling to the bottom of the boat.
&ldquo;But think of the picture he would have made!
&lsquo;Pike caught by girl in Duncan&rsquo;s Bay on Isle
Royale.&rsquo; Can&rsquo;t you just see it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; she mused as the darkness
deepened, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so much of that kind
of publicity. If we could only have our pictures
taken with some innocent wild creature
we have saved from destruction, how much
better that would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was about this last remark an element
of prophecy. But unconscious of all this,
Florence took up the oars and prepared for
a moonlit row back to the camping grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; She suddenly held up a hand for
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Across the narrow bay there ran a whisper.
Next moment the glassy surface was broken
by ten million ripples. At the same time a
cloud covered the moon, and the world went
inky black.</p>
<p>Directing her course more by instinct than
sight, Florence sent her boat gliding right to
the bottle necked entrance to the bay. Then
the moon came out.</p>
<p>For some time they sat in their tiny craft
and stared in amazement. Beyond the entrance
to Duncan&rsquo;s Bay lies a mile of jagged,
rock-walled shore line. Against this wall
waves were now breaking. As the two girls
watched, they saw white sheets of foam rise
thirty feet in air to spray one section of rocky
wall only to rush on and on out to sea until it
ended in a final burst of fury far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Florence sighed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re here for
the night, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; her tone changed. &ldquo;Wonder
if Greta&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta was not back. As they grounded their
boat on the sandy beach, no dancing sprite
came to meet them. Florence cupped her hand
for a loud &ldquo;Whoo-hoo!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo-hoo,&rdquo; came echoing back from the
other shore. After that the woods and waters
were still. Only the distant sound of rushing
waters against rocky shores beat upon their
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll build a rousing campfire,&rdquo; Florence
said as she sprang ashore. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s lost her
way she&rsquo;ll see the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small, dead fir tree offered tinder. The
scratch of a match, then the fire flamed high.
Larger branches of poplar and mountain ash
gave a steadier blaze. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sure to see that,&rdquo;
Florence sighed as she settled down upon a
log.</p>
<p>There was not long to wait. Greta had indeed
caught sight of that bursting flame. She
had not, however, been lost. Truth is, she had
never been lost in her life. There are those
who have the gift of location; they always
know where they are. It was so with Greta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls! Oh, girls!&rdquo; She came bursting
through the bush. &ldquo;The strangest thing! A
violin! A phantom violin! I&rsquo;m sure it was a
phantom. Who else could be playing so divinely
up there on that ridge at this hour of
the night? Such music!&rdquo; She drew in a long
breath. &ldquo;Such music you never heard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>She began a wild dance about the fire that
surely must have equaled any performance
there in the brave days of long ago when only
Indians came to pitch their tents on this narrow
camping ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Florence as a broad smile overspread
her face, &ldquo;tell us what really happened
up there on the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta did tell them. With the light of the
fire playing upon her animated features, she
told her story so convincingly that even Florence
was more than half convinced that
Greenstone Ridge truly was haunted by the
ghost of some violinist of enduring fame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that, one more strange thing,&rdquo;
Greta went on. &ldquo;I went racing headlong down
the trail until I almost pitched myself into the
antlers of a giant moose who hadn&rsquo;t heard me
coming. That frightened me. I went head first
down the ridge to tumble against a tree. When
I picked myself up I was at the top of one
more rocky cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I stood there panting,&rdquo; she took in a long
breath. &ldquo;I listened for the moose. They don&rsquo;t
chase you, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not often, I guess.&rdquo; Florence threw fresh
fuel on the fire. &ldquo;Well, this one didn&rsquo;t. But
I was afraid he might. So I waited and listened.&rdquo;
Greta paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was dark by that time,&rdquo; she went on at
last. &ldquo;I looked down where you should be, and
saw nothing. I looked back at the ridge. It
sort of curves there, and&mdash;&rdquo; Again she took a
long breath. &ldquo;I saw a light, thin, pale green
light. It seemed to hover on the side of the
ridge. I&mdash;it&mdash;it frightened me. At first it
seemed to move. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s coming this way!&rsquo; I told
myself. And you&rsquo;d better believe my heart
danced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t move. Just hung there against
the rocks. So, pretty soon I climbed back up
to the trail and ran, fast as I dared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;what do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Florence chuckled, &ldquo;you have
been seeing things!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And hearing them,&rdquo; Jeanne added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; Greta spoke in a
sober tone. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that music could
have been played on the radio? That my ears
picked it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence replied at once. &ldquo;I think
that&rsquo;s nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the little French girl was not sure. She
had heard of such things. Why doubt them
altogether? Besides, here was a beautiful,
glorious mystery. What more could one ask?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greta, I envy you!&rdquo; She threw her arms
about the little musician. &ldquo;You are the discoverer
of a great mystery. But we shall unravel
this mystery together, you and I. Is it
not so? <i>Mais oui!</i> And Florence,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;our big, brave Florence, she shall protect us
from all evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end Florence was to have a word or
two to say about this. If there were mysteries
to solve, she must play some more active part
than merely that of policeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />A STRANGE CATCH</h2>
<p>In the meantime there were things to do.
The boat must be dragged up and turned
over, to afford them a shelter for the night.
Balsam tips must be gathered. These are nature&rsquo;s
mattresses. Over these their blankets
must be spread. This accomplished, they
would think of supper.</p>
<p>Three pairs of eager hands accomplished
all this in a surprisingly short time. Then,
over a fire that had burned down to a bed of
glowing coals, they brewed strong tea, toasted
bread, broiled bacon, and in the end enjoyed
a delicious feast.</p>
<p>After this, with a great log at their backs,
they sat staring dreamily at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good to live,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to live,&rdquo; Florence echoed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And breathe,&rdquo; Greta added. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
know how it feels to take one long, deep breath
of this glorious air, after you have struggled
and struggled just for a tiny breath of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time after that they sat in silence.
Florence was thinking of the wreck, wondering
what might be happening to it in their
absence. In her short sojourn there she had
come to love the old <i>Pilgrim</i> that would sail
no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A diver,&rdquo; she whispered low. &ldquo;He came in
search of something. I wonder what? Will
I ever know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s thoughts were in far-away France.
The glowing coals reminded her of many another
campfire that had warmed her on the
sloping hillsides of France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bihari,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I wonder where he
and his gypsy band are tonight?&rdquo; He had returned
to France. She had left him there. But
gypsies seldom remain in one place. &ldquo;He may
be back in America.&rdquo; She listened to the rustle
of cottonwood leaves. They seemed to say,
&ldquo;He is in America; you will see him soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how could this be?&rdquo; She smiled at her
own fancy. &ldquo;He is a gypsy. I am on an island.
Can he drive his van across miles of water?&rdquo;
But gypsies, she knew right well, went where
they chose. Neither wind, storm nor broad
waters could stop them.</p>
<p>As for Greta, she was hearing again the
magic music of the phantom violin. &ldquo;Some
day,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;I shall see that violin
and the hands that created that entrancing
melody.&rdquo; But would she? Who could tell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Florence at last broke in
upon these reveries, &ldquo;Swen is a fine boy. I
wish we could help him with that boat affair
he told about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What boat affair?&rdquo; Jeanne looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember? He said it would
help the whole island. There are many fishermen
living all around the island. A boat comes
twice a week for their fish. And the captain
pays so very little for their fish! In these hard
times money is so scarce the fishermen are
being obliged to stay on the island all winter.
And some of them have no opportunity to
send their children to school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swen says they are trying to charter a
boat so they can carry their own fish to market.
Not a big boat, but large enough. They&rsquo;ve
got some money pledged. But it is not enough.
So there you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swen was a fine young fisher boy whose
nets were set not far from the wrecked <i>Pilgrim</i>.</p>
<p>He it had been, who pointed out to them
what a wonderful summer home the wreck
might become. For a very little pay he had
assisted them in fitting up their rooms. He
had rented them a boat and had thrown in
much equipment besides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine boy,&rdquo; Florence repeated. &ldquo;When
hard times came he was planning to enter
college. Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if we only could help him!&rdquo; Jeanne
put in eagerly. &ldquo;He might go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They live in a lighthouse,&rdquo; Greta said, &ldquo;he
and his people do. He told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How romantic!&rdquo; Jeanne hugged her knees.
&ldquo;We should see him in his lighthouse tower.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But most of all I wish we could help him,&rdquo;
Florence said. &ldquo;All we need&mdash;&rdquo; she prodded
the ground with a sharp stick. &ldquo;All we need is
a barrel of gold. Greta wants a fine music
teacher. I&rsquo;d love to travel. Swen wants a boat
for his people. And you, Jeanne, what is it
you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Jeanne laughed. &ldquo;Only happiness for
all my good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A barrel of gold,&rdquo; Florence repeated
dreamily. &ldquo;And perhaps it is right beneath
us, in this very soil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beneath us?&rdquo; Greta stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? A very small barrel, even a tiny
keg. This spot, the only level ground on the
shores of this bay, has been a camping ground
for countless generations. The Indians came
to Isle Royale to pound out native copper
from the rocks. They built their campfires
right here. Swen says if you dig down you
will find the remains of those campfires still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thrilling!&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s eyes were large
with wonder. &ldquo;Suppose we dug down and
found some treasure&mdash;a barrel of&mdash;. But then,
Indians didn&rsquo;t have barrels, not even kegs.&rdquo;
Her dream faded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The voyageurs did,&rdquo; Florence encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traders who came after the Indians.
They camped here on their way across the
lake. Can&rsquo;t you see them?&rdquo; With outstretched
hands, the big girl stared into the darkness
that is Duncan&rsquo;s Bay at night. &ldquo;Great, stalwart
men, muscles like iron bands, faces
browned by the sun, eyes ever looking forward
to fresh fields of adventure, the voyageurs!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped to a low
note of mystery, &ldquo;perhaps they camped here
one night with a great bag of gold. Perhaps
they were expecting an attack by Indians and,
thrusting their gold in their water barrel, buried
it here, never to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne smiled doubtfully, &ldquo;perhaps
they did. Anyway, you are right on one score.
It&rsquo;s a barrel of gold we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; Florence laughed, &ldquo;what we
need most is a good night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their balsam-scented bed at last called them
to rest. They went reluctantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Greta and Jeanne were weary. After listening
for a time to the constant rush of water
against the rocky shores of Blake&rsquo;s Point and
staring at the ribs of their boat just over their
heads, they fell asleep.</p>
<p>Florence did not fare so well. Lying there
in that narrow bed beneath their boat, she
found her mind going over the events of the
day and of those days that had gone before.</p>
<p>The adventure with that great pike had excited
her beyond belief. Ever a child of nature,
she had experienced in this event a return to
the wild desires of her early ancestors. They
had been wanderers, adventurers, hunters,
fishermen, explorers. The world had changed.
Her people were now city dwellers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she felt her splendid muscles
swell, &ldquo;adventure has not passed from the
earth. There still are adventures for those who
desire them, clean, clear adventures. One&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>She broke short off to sit straight up. The
stretch of level land on which they were
camped was hardly a hundred feet wide. Back
of that was a sloping hillside where the spruce,
balsam and pine of a primeval forest battled
for a place in the sun. From this forest she had
caught some faint sound, the snap of a twig,
the click of some hard object against a stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be men,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Just over
that ridge is Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor. Many people
there. But such a trail! Straight up! And on
such a night. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it was again. She clenched her hands
hard to prevent crying out. A loud click had
sounded out in the night. &ldquo;Like the raising of
a rifle&rsquo;s hammer,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>But was it a rifle? She must see. Lying flat
down, she pushed the covers quietly aside,
rolled over twice and found herself beneath
the dark night sky.</p>
<p>The moon was still shining. Her eyes soon
accustomed themselves to the light. Still lying
flat on the damp earth, she listened with all
her ears. What she heard set her blood racing.
&ldquo;Footsteps,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They seemed very near, those footsteps.
But were they human footsteps? She doubted
it. And from this came a sense of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Raising herself on one elbow she peered
into the night. At that moment a loud groan
sent the chills down her spine.</p>
<p>Next instant she was ready to laugh. A
giant old patriarch of his tribe, a moose with
wide-spreading antlers had stepped out into
the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moose,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Swen says
there are a thousand or more on the island,
and that they are harmless. But how old and
feeble this one seems!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had judged correctly. The moose was
nearing the end of his days. His giant antlers
were a burden. He walked very slowly and
with many a groan. On the island he was
known as Old Uncle Ned.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s lips were parted in a smile when,
of a sudden, the blood seemed to freeze in her
veins. A second creature had appeared at the
edge of the forest&mdash;a great, gaunt wolf.</p>
<p>At this instant, with one more groan, Old
Uncle Ned stepped into the water prepared to
swim across the bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The bit of wild life drama witnessed by the
girl during the next moment will never leave
the walls of her memory. Neither the moose
nor the wolf had seen her. The moose, no
doubt, smelled fresh water grass on the other
side. The wolf was eager for a kill.</p>
<p>Waiting in the shadows, the killer opened
his mouth to show his white teeth, his lolling
tongue. But the instant the aged moose was
well in the water and, for the time, quite defenseless,
with one wild spring his pursuer
was after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;ll kill that moose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing what she did, in her excitement
Florence sprang to her feet, seized
the steel casting rod and, racing to the bank,
sent the red and white spoon darting toward
the swimming wolf.</p>
<p>The first cast fell short. The reel sang and
she rolled in for a second try. All this she
had done under the impulse of the moment,
without truly willing it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Next instant she was awake to reality, for
on a second cast the spoon, striking the wolf
on the back, slid down to at last entangle the
three-pronged hook in the tangled hair of his
bushy tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne! Greta!&rdquo; the girl screamed. &ldquo;Wake
up! I&rsquo;ve caught a wolf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up yourself,&rdquo; Jeanne replied dreamily.
&ldquo;You are walking in your sleep. You let
that fish free long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Florence, quite beside herself,
protested. &ldquo;Get up! Quick! Quick! I&rsquo;ve
caught a wolf. A real wolf of the forest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time she was saying to herself,
&ldquo;Whatever am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />THE LAST PASSENGERS</h2>
<p>Florence had the wolf by the tail, there
could be no doubt about that. The three-pronged
hook of her trolling spoon was securely
entangled in that bushy mat of hair.
The line that held the spoon was strong. What
was she to do next?</p>
<p>The aged moose, awakened to his peril by
the sound of her voice, threw his head about,
took one startled look, then grunting prodigiously,
went swimming for the other shore.</p>
<p>Turning angrily, the wolf began snapping
at the hook. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do to let him take more
line,&rdquo; the girl told herself. &ldquo;Got to give the
poor old moose a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Greta rolled from beneath
the boat, leaped to her feet to stand staring,
wild eyed, at the scene before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! It&rsquo;s a wolf!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; Florence laughed
in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&mdash;let him go! Throw down the rod!
Let him go!&rdquo; Jeanne cried as she came
tumbling out from her bed.</p>
<p>But Florence held tight. When the wolf
turned about to snap at the line, she reeled
in. When he started away, she gave him line,
but not too much. There was the venerable
moose to consider. Having started the affair,
she was determined to finish it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice dropped to a
terrified whisper. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see he&rsquo;s turning?
He&mdash;he&rsquo;s coming this way. He&rsquo;ll eat us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, calmed by her sense of danger, she
rushed back to the half burned out campfire,
seized two smouldering sticks and waved
them to a red glow. Rushing forward, she
threw one at the gray beast who was indeed
swimming toward the camping ground.</p>
<p>The flaming stick struck the water with a
vicious sizzle. Black on the instant, it nevertheless
left its imprint on the wolf&rsquo;s brain.
Once again he wheeled about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The moose by this time had climbed up the
opposite bank and disappeared, as much as to
say, &ldquo;Well, you go ahead and fight it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to say, Florence at this moment began
losing her calm assurance. She reeled in
when perhaps she should have given line. It
was astonishing the way the wolf came in.
He had not half the pull of the great fish.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, his feet were on a sandbar.
After that it was quite another story. He
was not looking for a fight, that wolf. He was
looking only for safety. With a mad dash
he was down the sandbar, up the bank and
into the forest.</p>
<p>Completely unnerved at last, Florence lost
all control of the reel. After spinning round
and round like mad, it came to a jerking halt.
For one split second there was a tremendous
strain on the line, then it fell limp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed. &ldquo;Broke
the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he did. I&rsquo;m going to see.&rdquo; To her
companions&rsquo; utter consternation, Florence followed
the wolf into the dark forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>She returned some moments later. In her
hand was the red and white spoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went round a tree and tore the hook out
of his tail,&rdquo; she explained calmly. &ldquo;See! Some
gray hairs!&rdquo; She held it out for inspection.
&ldquo;Gray hairs, that&rsquo;s all I get. But the moose
got his life back, for a time at least. Perhaps
he&rsquo;s learned his lesson and won&rsquo;t try swimming
bays again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained, throwing some
bits of birch bark on the fire and fanning them
into a blaze, &ldquo;a moose is practically powerless
in deep water. If you catch up with him when
you&rsquo;re in a canoe, you may leap into the water,
climb on his back, and have a ride. He can&rsquo;t
hurt you. But on land&mdash;that&rsquo;s a different matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little drama played through, a tragedy
of the night averted, Jeanne and Greta crept
back among the blankets beneath the boat
and, like two squirrels in a nest of leaves, fell
fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Florence remained outside. The wind had
dropped, but still the rush of waves might be
heard on the distant shore. This wild throbbing
made her restless. She thought of the
wreck. How was it standing the storm? Well
enough, she was sure of that. But other more
terrible storms? Her brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could camp here,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Get
a tent or have some one build us a rough
cabin. Stay all summer. But then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already she had begun to love their life
on the wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Different!
And in this life that&rsquo;s what one wants, things
that are different, experiences that are different,
a whole life that is different from any
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she laughed a low laugh, &ldquo;looks as
if we were going to get just that, whether we
stay on the wreck or on land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts were now on the mysterious
black schooner that had visited the wreck the
night before, and now on Greta&rsquo;s phantom
violin and the strange green light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May never happen again,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;For all that, Greta will go back again and
again, when it is quite dark. People are like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had turned about and was considering
a return to her nest beneath the boat when, of
a sudden, she dropped on her knees in the
dark shadows of a wild cranberry bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something moving,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;moving out there in the channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first she thought it a swimming moose,
and laughed at her own sudden shock. Not
for long, for as the thing came into clearer
view she saw it was a power boat.</p>
<p>Moving along, it glided past her, dark, silent,
mysterious in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black schooner!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Wonder if it&rsquo;s been to the wreck!&rdquo; Her
heart sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; came as an afterthought. &ldquo;It has
been too stormy. They are putting in here for
the rest of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the schooner had passed on quite out
of sight, she made her way to the overturned
boat, crept beneath it and had soon found
herself a cozy spot among the blankets. She
did not fall asleep at once. In time the silence
lulled her to repose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>When she awoke there was the odor of coffee
and bacon in the air. Greta and Jeanne
were getting breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boats leave no trail,&rdquo; she assured herself.
&ldquo;Unless they have seen the black schooner,
I will not tell them it passed in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bright glitter was on the surface of the
bay. Old Superior had put on a bland and
smiling face. No trace now of last night&rsquo;s
boisterous roaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get back to the <i>Pilgrim</i> as soon as
breakfast is over,&rdquo; Florence decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the barrel of gold?&rdquo; Greta protested.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to dig for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of the talk they had had
about the campfire, of the Indians, trappers
and traders who had camped here for hundreds
of years. In a flight of fancy she had
dug a barrel of gold from beneath the sandy
surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No gold digging today,&rdquo; Florence laughed.
&ldquo;No spade. But you&rsquo;ll see! There&rsquo;s another
day coming. We&rsquo;ll find it, don&rsquo;t you ever
doubt it, a whole barrel of gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was born to the wilds. High boots,
corduroy knickers, a blue chambray shirt, a
red necktie, these were her joy. She was as
much at home in a boat as a cowboy is in a
saddle. Breakfast over, she sent their light
craft skimming through the narrows and out
into the broad stretch of water lying between
Blake&rsquo;s Point and the reef that was the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s</i>
last resting place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look how he smiles!&rdquo; she cried, throwing
back her head. &ldquo;Old Superior, the great deceiver!
You can&rsquo;t trust him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed you cannot. When a storm
comes sweeping in over those miles of black
waters and the fog horn on Passage Island
adds its hoarse voice to the tumult of the
waves, it is a terrible thing to hear those waves
come roaring in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Florence had accepted the judgment of old
time fishermen that for the time the wreck
was a safe place to be. But this morning her
brow wrinkled. &ldquo;What if it should be carried
out to sea!&rdquo; she thought with a shudder. &ldquo;And
we, the last passengers, on board!&rdquo; She said
never a word to her companions who, reflecting
the smile of Old Superior, were deliriously
happy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />DIZZY&rsquo;S WELCOME</h2>
<p>As they neared the wreck, from somewhere
inside it came one wild scream, then the
maddest laugh one might ever hope to hear.
Just such a laugh as on that other night had
completed the task of turning Jeanne into a
ghost and frightening the mysterious men of
the black schooner away.</p>
<p>Had some stranger been present, he might
have expected at this moment to see Florence
drop her oars in surprise and consternation.
Instead, she rowed calmly on, chuckling
meanwhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dizzy&rsquo;s welcome!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Dizzy!&rdquo; Jeanne chimed in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Dizzy, as they had named him, had been
aboardship when they arrived. At least they
had found him swimming frantically about in
the one-time dining room of the ship. He was
a large loon. Crippled by some accident so he
could not fly, he had somehow got into this
place, but had failed to find his way out.</p>
<p>Almost starved, he had appeared to welcome
their arrival. They had bought fresh
trout and fed him. From this time on, with
no apparent desire to leave the place, he had
become a devoted pet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be joining you shortly,&rdquo; Florence
cried out to him as the boat bumped the side
of the ship. This news was answered by one
more delirious burst of mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One could almost think he was human!&rdquo;
Greta shuddered in spite of herself. For her
this old ship had a haunting appearance.</p>
<p>Old Superior is ever ready enough to display
his various moods. The girls had not
been aboard an hour when a dense fog came
sweeping in from the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never find our way if we were out there
now,&rdquo; Florence said with a shrug of her stout
shoulders.</p>
<p>There came a slow, drizzling rain, followed
by more and denser fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Two hours later a wild storm came sweeping
in. Sheets of water, seeming at times to
leap from the very lake, dashed against narrow
cabin windows. There was a ceaseless
wash-wash of waves against the black hull of
the wreck. What did this mean to the happy
trio? Nothing at all. They were down in
their private swimming pool with Dizzy. Such
a strange and wonderful swimming pool as
it was too! Once the dining saloon of the
great ship, it now lacked both chairs and
tables, but the decorative railing leading to
the floor above made a perfect diving board.
A second rail ran slantwise into the water
that at the far end must be twenty feet in
depth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot the shoots!&rdquo; Greta cried as, sitting
astride the rail, she shot downward to hit the
water with a splash and to go swimming away.
How Dizzy beat the water with his wings
and screamed! How they laughed and
splashed him! How he dove and swam!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Jeanne bubbled, her
mouth half filled with water. &ldquo;And to think,&rdquo;
she exclaimed as she dragged herself to a
place beside Florence on the topmost step of
the broad stairway, &ldquo;to think that only a short
time back all this was swarming with people
off on a holiday! Some gay, some solemn,
some rich, some poor, but all promenading the
deck and all coming in here for their dinner.
And now look! Here we are, only three. And
it is all ours! And look at the cabins! Rows
of them on either side, high and dry, half of
them. People could sleep in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they never will,&rdquo; Florence said soberly.
&ldquo;We are the old ship&rsquo;s last passengers, no
doubt about that. Next winter ice will form
on the bay. It may be a foot thick. Then a
storm will come roaring in and break it all up.
The ice will come tearing at the old ship and
cut her in pieces, if she lasts that long.&rdquo; Florence
had not meant to add this last bit; it just
came out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the ship will last the summer
through.&rdquo; There was the slightest tremor in
Jeanne&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Everyone says that. S-o-o-o!&rdquo;
she cried in her old merry way, &ldquo;Let us enjoy
it all while we may!&rdquo; Once again she sat
astride the rail to go sliding down and lose
herself in a mass of foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old ships,&rdquo; Florence thought, &ldquo;are like old
houses. They have secrets to tell. What
stories the doors to those cabins could relate!&rdquo;
Her eyes swept the long array of cabin doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets they keep,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And
treasures they sometimes hide, these old
ships.&rdquo; She was wondering what the secrets
of this old ship were and whether after all
there was some treasure hidden here.</p>
<p>They had set up a small stove in the captain&rsquo;s
cabin. Five minutes later they were all
three doing a wild Indian dance round the
fire. This ended by a pow-wow in blankets,
then a feast of smoked trout, hard crackers
and some hot drink only Jeanne knew how to
make. And still, outside, the wind drove rain
against the windowpanes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she lasts that long,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered
under her breath. She was thinking of Florence&rsquo;s
words about the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>For the time it appeared there was nothing
to fear. The wind dropped at sunset. Clouds
went scudding away and the moon, shining
like a newly polished copper kettle, hung over
all.</p>
<p>After Greta and Jeanne had crept into their
berths, Florence slipped into knickers and
mackinaw to climb the steps leading to the
bridge. There, while the moon sank lower and
lower, she paced slowly back and forth.</p>
<p>In common with all other girls, this big girl
had her dreams. Strange dreams they were
that night. For her the ship was not a wreck,
but a living ship riding on an even keel, plowing
its way through the dark night waters.
She was the captain on the bridge. From time
to time, as if for a word with the wheelman,
she paused in her march; at times, too, appeared
to jangle a bell. For the most part
she paced slowly back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she murmured at last. &ldquo;Why
should I not some day command a ship? I
am strong as a man. There would be things
to learn. I could master them as well as any
man, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>She paused for a moment&rsquo;s reflection. Had
there been other lady captains? Yes, she had
read stories of one who commanded a tugboat
in Puget Sound.</p>
<p>And there had been the lady of the &ldquo;Christmas
Tree Ship.&rdquo; The husband of this Christmas
tree lady had been lost on his craft while
bringing thousands of Christmas trees to Chicago.
She had chartered another ship and had
carried on his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a glorious task!&rdquo; the girl murmured.
&ldquo;Bringing Christmas trees to the people of a
great city!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead now,&rdquo; she recollected, &ldquo;that
lady captain is dead. The Christmas tree ship
sails no more. But it shall sail. Some day I
shall be its captain. And Christmas trees shall
be free to all those who are poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing low, she once more resumed her
walk on the bridge. This time her thoughts
dwelt upon things very near at hand. &ldquo;This
wreck,&rdquo; she was thinking, &ldquo;this old <i>Pilgrim</i>&mdash;is
it a safe place to be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it just has to be!&rdquo; she exclaimed after
a moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a grand place
for the summer. Broad deck, sloping a little,
but not too terribly much. Cabins without
number, a swimming pool that once was a
dining hall. Who could ask for more? And
yet&mdash;&rdquo; her brow wrinkled. The little breezes
that blew across the water seemed to whisper
to her of danger.</p>
<p>At last, shaking herself free from all those
thoughts, she went down to her cabin and was
soon fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />THE CALL OF THE GYPSIES</h2>
<p>The following day was bright and clear.
The waters of Old Superior were as blue
as the sky. Even the wreck took on a scrubbed
and smiling appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if we were all prepared to shove off for
one more voyage,&rdquo; Jeanne said with a merry
laugh.</p>
<p>As soon as the sun had dried the deck,
Jeanne and Greta spread blankets and, stretching
themselves out like lazy cats, prepared for
a glorious sun bath.</p>
<p>It was a drowsy, dreamy day. In the distance
a dark spot against the skyline was Passage
Island where on stormy nights a search-light,
a hoarse-hooting fog horn and a whispering
radio warned ships of danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>All manner of ships pass between Isle
Royale and Passage Island. They were passing
now, slowly and, Jeanne thought, almost
mournfully. First came a dark old freighter
with cabins fore and aft, then a tugboat towing
a flat scow with a tall derrick upon it, and
after these, all painted white and with many
flags flying, an excursion boat. And then,
reared over on one side and scooting along
before the wind, a sailboat.</p>
<p>Just to lie in the sun and watch this procession
was life enough for Jeanne and Greta.
Not so Florence. She was for action. Dizzy
needed fish. She would row over to the shoals
by Blake&rsquo;s Point. There she would troll for
trout.</p>
<p>The water about Blake&rsquo;s Point is never still.
It is as if some great green serpent of the sea
lies stretched among the rocks and keeps it in
perpetual motion by waving his tail. It was
not still when Florence arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just right,&rdquo; she whispered, as if afraid the
fishes might hear. &ldquo;Rough enough for a little
excitement, and no real danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casting a shining lure into the water, she
watched the line play out as she rowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>A big wave lifted her high. Still the line
played out. The boat sank low. She checked
the line. Then, watching the rocks that she
might not come too close and snag them, she
rowed away.</p>
<p>For some time she circled out along the
shoals, then back again. She had begun to believe
there were no fish, and was musing on
other things, phantom violins, black schooners,
gray wolves, Old Uncle Ned, when, with
a suddenness that was startling, her reel began
to sing.</p>
<p>Dropping her oars, she seized the pole and
began reeling in rapidly. Next moment she
tossed a fine three pound trout into her boat.
&ldquo;You get &rsquo;em quick or not at all,&rdquo; Swen had
said to her. She had got this one &ldquo;quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later four fine trout lay in the
stern of her boat. &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; she breathed.
&ldquo;We eat tonight, and so does Dizzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was still young. She had not meant
to visit Duncan&rsquo;s Bay, but now the place
called to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Swen&rsquo;s short, powerful rifle lay in the prow
of her boat. Why had she brought it? Perhaps
she could not tell. Now she was glad it
was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ashore on Duncan&rsquo;s Bay,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Go hunting phantoms and, perhaps, a
gray wolf or two. Wouldn&rsquo;t mind shooting
them, the murderers, not a bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange wolf she was to come upon
in the forest that day.</p>
<p>With corduroy knickers tucked in high
laced boots, a flannel shirt open wide at the
neck, and a small hat crammed well down on
her head, this stalwart girl might have been
taken for a man as, rifle under arm, she
trudged through the deep shadows of the evergreen
forest covering the slope of Greenstone
Ridge.</p>
<p>That she was in her element was shown by
the spring in her footstep, the glad, eager
look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life!&rdquo; she breathed more than once. &ldquo;Life!
How marvelous it is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I love life!&rsquo;&rdquo; She hummed the words of
a song she had once heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Life! Life!&rdquo; she whispered. Here indeed
was life in its most primitive form. At times
through a narrow opening she caught a
glimpse of gray gulls soaring like phantom
ships over the water. To her ears came the
long, low whistle of some strange bird. She
was not surprised when she found herself
standing face to face with a magnificent
broad-antlered moose. She stood quite still.</p>
<p>Great eyed, the moose stared at her. A
sound to her right caught her attention. She
looked away for an instant. When her gaze
returned to the spot where the monarch of
the forest had stood, he had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she exclaimed low. &ldquo;Gone! He was
taller than a man, yet he vanished without a
sound! How strange! How sort of wonderful!
But I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was that sound from below.
Snapping of twigs and swishing of branches.
No moose that. She would see what was down
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>She did see, and that almost at once. A
few silent steps, and she came upon him&mdash;a
man. He was standing at a spot where a break
in the evergreens left a view of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay.</p>
<p>He was looking straight ahead. On his face
was a savage, hungry look. Only the night
before the girl had seen that same look in the
eyes of a wolf.</p>
<p>She was not long in learning the reason. In
plain view through that narrow gap was the
patriarch of his tribe, the moose she had saved
from the wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why that look?&rdquo; She was puzzled, but
not for long. In the hands of that man was a
rifle. An ugly smile overspread his face. His
teeth shone out like fangs as he lifted the rifle
and took deliberate aim at the moose.</p>
<p>She recalled Swen&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Isle Royale is
a game preserve. You will not be allowed to
kill even a rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is a poacher.&rdquo; Her mind, always
keen, worked quickly. &ldquo;I can save the moose,
and I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinging her own rifle into position, she
fired well over the heads of man and moose.
The shot rang out. The startled moose fled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>And the man? She did not pause to see.
Like a startled rabbit she went dodging and
gliding back and forth among the evergreens.
In her mind, repeated over and over, was the
question, &ldquo;Did he see me? Did he see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>After a long and glorious sun bath followed
by a delicious lunch served on deck, Jeanne
and Greta sat for a long time staring dreamily
at the sea. Then Jeanne, throwing off her
velvet robe, stood up, slim and straight, on
the planked deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if I can have forgotten,&rdquo; she murmured.
Then, seizing a tambourine, she began
a slow, gliding and weaving motion that,
like some beautiful work evolved from nothing
by the painter&rsquo;s skillful hand, became a
fantastic and wonderful dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>For a full quarter hour Greta sat spellbound.
She had seen dancing, but none like
this. Now the tambourine was rattling and
whirling over the little French girl&rsquo;s head,
and now it lay soundless on the deck. Now
the dancer whirled so fast she was but a gleam
of white and gold. And now her arms moved
so slowly, her body turned so little, she might
have seemed asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; cried Greta. &ldquo;That was
marvelous! Where did you learn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsies taught me.&rdquo; Dropping upon
the deck, Jeanne rolled herself in a blanket
like a mummy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;believe that all
gypsies are bad. That is not so. One of the
very great preachers was a gypsy&mdash;not a converted
gypsy&mdash;just a gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bihari and his wife were my godparents
in France. They were wandering gypsies, but
such wonderful people! They took me when I
had no home. They gave me shelter. I learned
to dance with my bear, such a wonderful bear.
He is dead now, and Bihari is gone. I wish
they were here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next moment she went rolling over and
over on the deck. Springing like a beautiful
butterfly from a cocoon, she whirled away in
one more riotous dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>It was in the midst of this that a strange
thing happened. Music came to them from
across the waters&mdash;wild, delirious music.</p>
<p>Jeanne paused in her wild dance. For a
space of seconds she stood there drinking in
that wild glory of sound.</p>
<p>Then, as if caught by some spell, she began
once more to dance. And her dance, as Greta
expressed it later, was &ldquo;like the dance of the
angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greta,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered hoarsely when
at last the music ceased and she threw herself
panting on the deck, &ldquo;that is gypsy music!
No others can make music like that. There is
a boat load of gypsies out there by Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; Greta sprang to her feet. &ldquo;See!
It is a white boat. It is just about to enter
the Narrows. Perhaps Florence will see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence&mdash;&rdquo; There was a note of pain in
Jeanne&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Florence has the boat. I cannot
go to them. Perhaps I shall not see them&mdash;my
friends, the gypsies. And they make music,
such divine music!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Music&mdash;divine music,&rdquo; Greta whispered
with sudden shock. &ldquo;Can one of these have
been my phantom violinist?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she decided after a moment&rsquo;s contemplation,
&ldquo;that was different. None of these
could have played like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the call!&rdquo; Jeanne cried, springing to
her feet and stretching her arms toward the
distant shore. Fainter, more indistinct now
the music reached their ears. &ldquo;The gypsies&rsquo;
call! I have no boat. I cannot go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />SILENT BATTLE</h2>
<p>Ten minutes of running and dodging
brought Florence, still gripping her rifle,
squarely against a towering wall of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see me?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;And
if he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping back into the protecting branches
of a black old fir tree, she stood breathing
hard, listening.</p>
<p>Her mind was in a whirl. She had saved
the moose. But what of herself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a foolish thing to do,&rdquo; she muttered
low. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mind took another turn. Who was this
man? Certainly he was breaking the law. No
man had a right to kill a moose on Isle Royale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are one of the great joys of the
island,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Hundreds of people
come just to see them. Nowhere else can one
see them so easily and safely in their native
haunts. If men begin to shoot them they will
go to the heart of the island and no one will
see them. What a pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, who was this man? She thought of
the black schooner that had come creeping up
the bay in the dead of night and that other
one Jeanne had seen by the wrecked ship.
Were they the same? And did this man belong
to that schooner? To none of these questions
could she form a positive answer.</p>
<p>When she had rested there in the shadows
until she was sure the man had not followed
her, she went gliding along beneath the rocky
ridge, then started, slipping and sliding downward,
to the camping ground.</p>
<p>Like a patient steed her boat lay waiting on
the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should hurry back to the ship,&rdquo; she told
herself. But the waters of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay, so
peaceful, so undisturbed and deserted, seemed
to call. She answered that call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>After rowing quietly for a half hour, she
dropped her oars, took up her rod and began
to cast. Her reel sang, the spoon gave off a
silvery gleam as, cutting a narrow arc
through the air, it sank from sight.</p>
<p>Without truly hoping to catch a fish, she
reeled in slowly. She repeated this again and
again. Her boat was drifting. She gave no
attention to that. Each cast was straighter,
longer than the last. Here was real sport.</p>
<p>But wait! Of a sudden the pole was fairly
yanked from her hand. &ldquo;A fish!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Oh! A fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reeled in rapidly. The fish came up from
the deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a poor little four pound pike,&rdquo; she
sighed as she shook him free.</p>
<p>The little pike had three brothers; at least
she hooked that number and threw them back.</p>
<p>Then came a sudden shock. It was as if a
powerful man had seized her lure and given
it a terrific yank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the big boy again, or his brother.&rdquo;
She was thinking of that other night with
Jeanne. She set her shoulders for a tussle. &ldquo;If
it is&mdash;&rdquo; She set her teeth tight. &ldquo;Watch me
land him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;tussle&rdquo; never rightly began. With a
suddenness beyond power to describe, a voice
in her very ear said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! Now I have you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the man who meant to murder the
aged moose. In his two gnarled hands he
gripped a stout ashen oar. The oar was raised
for a blow.</p>
<p>What had happened was this. Her mind
fully occupied with the fishing adventure, the
girl had allowed her boat to drift farther and
farther into the bay. She had at last come
within the stranger&rsquo;s view. Still angry because
of his interrupted piece of vandalism, he had
pushed off from the shore and, by using an
oar for a paddle, had stolen upon her unobserved.</p>
<p>That there would be a battle the strong girl
did not doubt. How would it end? Who could
say? Her pulse pounded madly as she reached
for her own oar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>The two small boats were a full mile from
the Narrows, through which one enters Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay. At that moment a white fishing
boat, fully forty feet long and gay with all
manner of flags and bunting, was entering the
Narrows.</p>
<p>There were a number of men and women on
board, all gayly dressed, and, until a few moments
before, enjoying a grand fete of music
and dancing. Now they were silent. Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay affects all in this same manner. Dark,
mysterious, deserted, it seems to speak of the
past. A hush falls upon all alike as they pass
between the narrow, sloping walls that stand
beside the entrance to this place of strange
enchantment.</p>
<p>Conspicuous because of his size and apparent
strength, one man stood out from the other
voyagers. Garbed in green breeches and a
gayly decorated vest, he stood at the prow,
massive brown arms folded, silently directing
the course of the boat by a slight swaying,
this way and that, of his powerful body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Florence was quick. Hours of work in a
gymnasium each day for months on end had
given her both the speed and strength of a
tiger. Before the intruder could strike she had
seized her oar and was prepared to parry the
blow.</p>
<p>The oars came together with a solid thwack.
Not a word was said as they drew back for a
second sally. This was to be a silent battle.</p>
<p>The man tried a straight on, sword-like
thrust. It became evident at once that he
meant to plunge her into the icy water. What
more?</p>
<p>Swinging her oar in a circle, she struck his
weapon such a blow as all but knocked it from
his hands.</p>
<p>Before he could regain his grip, she sent a
flashing blow that barely missed his head,
coming down with a thud upon his back.</p>
<p>Turning upon her a face livid with anger,
he executed a crafty thrust to the right, leading
her weapon astray. Before she could recover,
her boat tipped. She fell upon one knee.
At the same instant there came a crashing
blow that all but downed her for a count of
ten. The man smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done!&rdquo; her aching heart seemed to
whisper.</p>
<p>But what was this? There came the sound
of heavy feet dropping upon the bottom of
the boat. This was followed by a wolf-like
growl. Then came the panting breath of terrific
struggle.</p>
<p>Florence regained full consciousness in time
to see her adversary caught in the grip of a
powerful man, and to witness the feat of
strength that lifted him clear of the boat and
sent him sprawling into black waters a full
ten feet away.</p>
<p>At that her deliverer turned and smiled,
showing all his fine white teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bihari!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Bihari the gypsy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Florence.&rdquo; The man bowed.
&ldquo;Here we meet again. And this one&mdash;&rdquo; He
glanced at the man struggling in the water.
&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far to shore. Perhaps he can swim
that far.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I am sure of that.&rdquo; Bihari&rsquo;s grin
broadened. &ldquo;Come then, we will forget him.
You will come aboard our fine little schooner.
My good Mama will look you over and see if
you are hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her surprise Florence found the flag-bedecked
boat close at hand. The villainous intruder
had been outgeneraled by his own tactics.
He had come upon Florence silently, unobserved.
In this same manner Bihari, witnessing
the struggle, had stolen upon him.
Not, however, until he had won the battle had
Bihari discovered he was defending a long-time
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; his buxom wife cried as the girl
climbed aboard. &ldquo;It is indeed good to see you!
And where is my Jeanne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s not far away. You shall see her
within an hour if you choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose?&rdquo; Bihari laughed a great roaring
laugh. &ldquo;Have we not traveled half way round
the world that we might see her? Have we
not traded our vans for a boat that we might
come to this place? Show us the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw the wreck as you came in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wreck?&rdquo; Bihari stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wreck,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>Without another word this strange skipper
mounted the deck to begin that unusual directing
of his craft.</p>
<p>Four words came back to Florence, as with
her boat in tow, she rode in luxurious ease out
of the bay. &ldquo;We will forget him.&rdquo; Bihari had
said that. He had been speaking of the stranger.
Could they safely forget him? Something
seemed to tell her they could not.</p>

<br />SONG OF THE PHANTOM</h2>
<p>It is not difficult to imagine Jeanne&rsquo;s wild
joy when, after an hour of disappointment
because she had no boat for rowing to Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay, she saw the gay gypsy boat slip
from out the Narrows and head straight for
the spot where she stood upon the sloping
deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried to Greta. &ldquo;They are coming!
Florence has found them. She knows
how I love gypsies who are good. She will
bring them.&rdquo; She sprang into a dance so wild
that Greta thought she would spin quite off
the deck and go flying through the air to meet
the gay white boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Bihari!&rdquo; she exclaimed at last,
throwing herself down upon the deck. &ldquo;It just
cannot be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>It was Bihari for all that. The schooner
was still an arm&rsquo;s length from the side of the
wreck when with one wild leap Jeanne was in
Madame Bihari&rsquo;s strong arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne! My Petite Jeanne!&rdquo; the good woman
cried. Tears stood in her eyes. &ldquo;Jeanne,
you are with us once more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed hours of great joy, of music
and feasting; telling of stories, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In France,&rdquo; Bihari said to Jeanne, &ldquo;all is
beautiful. Every day grows longer without
you. We said, &lsquo;Well, we will return to America.&rsquo;
And here we are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came to Chicago. You were not there.
We came to the shore of Lake Superior. You
were not there. They said, &lsquo;She is on an island,
Isle Royale.&rsquo; We said, &lsquo;Take our vans. We
must have a boat.&rsquo; See! We have a boat. Is
it not a jolly one? And we have you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pointing at a
brown mass of fur against the cabin. &ldquo;See, we
have found you a bear. He is almost as wise
as your other one. And Mama here has taught
him some of your dances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he exclaimed, poking the sleeping
bear with his foot. &ldquo;Come! Dance for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unrolling himself, the bear stood up. At
first, still groggy with sleep, he looked more
like an empty sack trying to play it was a
man. When Bihari seized his violin and began
to play, it was as if the bear were run by a
motor and the current was suddenly turned
on. He began hopping about in a most grotesque
manner. Soon he and Jeanne were doing
a wild, weird dance.</p>
<p>Florence, accustomed to all this from the
past, sat looking on in silence. Greta too was
silent. Yet how strange it all seemed to her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Bihari shouted when the dance
was over. &ldquo;We will visit the island. We will
go to every place where there are people. They
shall have music and dancing, such entertainment
as they have never known before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The days that followed were one round of
joy for the little French girl. The old wreck
became once more a pleasure ship. Flags and
bunting were hung on every brace and spar.
The deserted cabins overflowed with life and
echoed sounds of joy from dawn to dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Great flat boxes of clay were brought from
the mainland. On these campfires were kindled.
Their red and yellow gleam might be
seen wavering upon the water far and near.
Strange dishes were prepared in kettles hung
over these fires. They feasted, danced, sang
and told stories by the hour. Both Jeanne and
Florence lived the life of the open as they had
lived it in France with Bihari and his band.</p>
<p>As for the dark-eyed Greta, it was all so
wild and strange she could only sit shyly
smiling in a corner, both charmed and bewildered
by the ways of these people of the open
road.</p>
<p>At times she stole away to the prow. One
night, when songs were loudest, she took her
violin from beneath her arm and played to the
rushing waves. Then again she would sit staring
away toward the land where no light
shone, dreaming strange dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; she would murmur, &ldquo;a barrel of
gold. Florence said there might be a barrel
of gold buried on the camping ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; she would exclaim, &ldquo;that is absurd!&rdquo;
In spite of all her denials, the conviction
clung to her that somehow, somewhere a
barrel of gold would play an important part
in her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how much that would be?&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;Enough for&mdash;for everything?&rdquo;
For a long time she had wished to study violin
under a very great master, and had not
been able.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money, money, money,&rdquo; she whispered
now. &ldquo;Some have much more than they need,
and some none at all. How strange life is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding in this no source of joy, she gazed
away toward the shores of Isle Royale, to
dream that she was once more listening to the
magic music of the phantom violin.</p>
<p>In this mood she took up her own violin
and was soon lost to all else in an attempt to
reproduce the notes of the haunting melody
that had come to her that night.</p>
<p>To her unspeakable joy, she found she could
catch here and there a few scattered notes.
With time it came to her more and more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>So engrossed was she in this joyous adventure
into the unknown, she did not know that
the gypsy songs had ceased, that soft padded
footsteps approached, that a little circle of
eager listeners had gathered about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; someone sighed as her last note died
away.</p>
<p>Then, in consternation she became conscious
of their presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; Bihari exclaimed. &ldquo;We have
artists of the violin in France. Few play more
wonderfully. What piece is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;&rdquo; Greta stared. &ldquo;Why, that is the song
of the phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Song of the phantom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta was obliged to tell her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no phantom!&rdquo; Bihari declared
stoutly. &ldquo;Some great artist is hidden away in
those hills. Why? I wonder. I should like very
much to hunt him out and sit at his feet. But
tomorrow&mdash;no, the day after&mdash;we become water
gypsies again. We must play and dance.
Coins must jingle, for we must live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; He turned eagerly to Jeanne.
&ldquo;You will go with us, round the island?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! She will go, Jeanne will go!&rdquo;
The gypsy band, all old friends, swarmed
about her. What more could she say but &ldquo;Yes,
I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she cried, gathering Greta and
Florence in her arms, &ldquo;you will go also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a grand adventure,&rdquo; Florence
replied, &ldquo;but Greta is here, in part to rest and
grow strong. I think we must stay and keep
the ship until your return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in the end this was agreed upon. &ldquo;And
we,&rdquo; Greta whispered to Florence, &ldquo;we shall
go over to Duncan&rsquo;s Bay. We shall dig for a
barrel of gold and hunt down the home of that
phantom who plays so divinely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;We will do just
that.&rdquo; But in her own mind&rsquo;s eye was the face
of a very ugly man. And that man was trying
to cut off her head with an ashen oar.</p>
<p>Next day was Sunday. There was no wild
and hilarious music on this day, for Bihari
and his band were deeply religious. All day
they sat about the ship, some in groups talking
quietly, and some alone meditating on the
ways of a great Creator who rules the waves
and watches over His children in all their wanderings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>As darkness fell a bright fire was lighted.
Bihari took down his violin and all joined in
those sacred melodies that belong to all time,
all lands and all people.</p>
<p>Next day, with many a shout of farewell,
the gypsy bark sailed away. And in the prow,
standing beside Bihari, was the little French
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in ten days,&rdquo; she shouted back
as the wreck began to grow small in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she?&rdquo; Florence whispered. &ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />GOLD</h2>
<p>Bihari and his gypsy band in their <i>Ship
of Joy</i> had scarcely passed from sight
around Blake&rsquo;s Point when the sun went under
a cloud and a damp, chill wind came driving
in from the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo! How cold!&rdquo; Greta wrapped her
sweater tight about her.</p>
<p>With the gay flags down, the hilarious music
stilled, the wreck seemed a cold, dull and
lifeless place. &ldquo;Something sinister and threatening
about it,&rdquo; Florence thought.</p>
<p>To Greta she said, &ldquo;Pack up the things
you&rsquo;ll need for ten days, plenty of warm stockings
and the like. We&rsquo;re going camping on
the island. We&rsquo;ll tramp all over Greenstone
Ridge and sleep where night overtakes us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Greta cried, &ldquo;will be grand! Shall
I take my violin?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. You might be able to take a few
lessons from your mysterious phantom,&rdquo;
Florence laughed as she began packing away
eatables that were both light and nourishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are streams and small lakes,&rdquo; she
murmured half to herself. &ldquo;We shall have fish
to fry, and some berries are ripe, blueberries,
raspberries and a sort I have never seen before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said to Greta as her feet touched
the shores of the camping ground on Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay, &ldquo;here we shall camp for the night. Tomorrow
we will go on. I mean to do a little
digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For gold?&rdquo; Greta stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a barrel of gold.&rdquo; Florence smiled.
&ldquo;Well, anyway, for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragging a small trench spade from her
pack, she studied the lay of the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where would one make camp?&rdquo; she
said thoughtfully as her keen eyes surveyed
the narrow patch of ground. &ldquo;Not too far
back. Campfire might be blown into the forest
and set the hillside blazing. Not too close
to the shore either. Wind might come up and
drive the waves over you while you slept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About here.&rdquo; She set her spade at the very
center of the level stretch of ground that in
all is not larger than one city lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Greta,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully
as she began to dig, &ldquo;it really doesn&rsquo;t matter
whether we find a barrel of gold. Very often
people are harmed by having too much money.
It&rsquo;s good for us to work. There are ways of
getting things we need&mdash;good stout clothes,
plain food, and all the education that&rsquo;s good
for us, if we are wise and really work hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may find gold. No one could be sure
we will not. We may find charcoal and
scorched bones. If we study these carefully
we can say, &lsquo;This fire was kindled two hundred
years ago, before ever white men set foot
on these shores.&rsquo; We will be adding a sentence
or two to Isle Royale&rsquo;s strange history. That&rsquo;s
something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we might&mdash;&rdquo; she was digging now,
cutting away the thin sod, then tossing out
shovelfuls of sandy soil. &ldquo;We might possibly
find some copper instruments crudely made
by the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; she stood erect for a moment.
&ldquo;That would be a great deal. Any museum
would pay well for those. Some may have
been found on the island, but I doubt it. But
it is known that the Indians came here from
the mainland to take chunks of solid copper
from the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had to heat the rock, build great
fires upon it, then drag the fire away and crack
the brittle hot rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copper!&rdquo; She breathed a deep breath.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have the island instead of
Canada. History, Greta, is truly fascinating
if you study it as we are doing now, right on
the ground. We&mdash;what&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; she broke
short off. Some metal object had clinked on
her spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its a coin!&rdquo; she exclaimed a moment later.
&ldquo;A very old coin, I am sure!&rdquo; She was all excitement.
&ldquo;Money! I told you, Greta! Gold!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>It was indeed a golden coin, very thin and
quite small for all that.
By careful scouring they managed to make
out that the words stamped on its face were
French. They could not read the date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; Greta seized the spade to begin digging
vigorously. &ldquo;Gold! There was a barrel
of gold! The barrel rotted long ago. But the
gold, it is still there. We will find it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very short time the slender girl found
her breath coming in deep pants. Blisters were
rising on her hands. She might soon have exhausted
herself had not Florence shoved her
gently to one side and taken the spade from
her.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the big girl had thrown
out but three shovelfuls of sand when again
her blade rang.</p>
<p>This time the earth yielded a greater treasure&mdash;not
gold, but copper. A small knife with
a thin blade and round handle of copper, it
showed the marks of the crude native smithy
who fashioned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the past!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s eyes gleamed.
&ldquo;The very distant past! How Doctor Cole of
the museum will exclaim over that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>So engrossed were the two girls in their
study of this new treasure, they failed to note
three facts. Darkness was falling. A stealthy
figure was creeping upon them in the shadows
of the forest. A short, powerful motor boat
had entered the Narrows and was headed for
the camping grounds.</p>
<p>In the meantime Jeanne had made an important
discovery. The <i>Ship of Joy</i> had gone
cruising round Blake&rsquo;s Point to turn in at a
narrow circular bay known as Snug Harbor.</p>
<p>Jeanne thought this one of the most beautiful
spots she had ever known. White lodge
building, more than half hidden by fir and
balsam, little cottages tucked away at the edge
of the forest, and about it all an air of quiet
and peace. They were at the door of Rock
Harbor Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will disturb their quiet,&rdquo; Jeanne
thought to herself, &ldquo;but not their peace, I am
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>While Bihari was talking with the owner of
the lodge regarding a night of music and
dancing, she stole away over a path shadowed
by mountain ash and fir. At the end of the
path she came to a long, low, private cottage,
boarded up and closed. Before this house a
long narrow dock ran out into the bay. Tied
to this dock was a schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black schooner!&rdquo; Jeanne shuddered.</p>
<p>Yet drawn toward it as a bird is drawn to
a snake, she walked slowly down the dock
to find herself at last peering inside the long,
low cabin.</p>
<p>At once she sprang back as if she had seen
someone. She had seen no one. The schooner
was for the moment deserted. What she had
seen, hanging against the wall, was a diver&rsquo;s
helmet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The black schooner!&rdquo; she murmured once
more as she hurried away, losing herself from
sight in the shadow of the forest.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Back on the camping ground, the first intimation
Florence and Greta had that there was
anyone about was when, with a startling suddenness,
a bright searchlight flashed into their
eyes. The light came from the water. At the
same time there came the sound of movement
in the dry leaves of the forest at their backs.
Instinctively Florence whirled about. Her
bright eyes searched the forest. No one was
there.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>When Jeanne once more reached the lodge
dock where the <i>Ship of Joy</i> was tied, a crowd
of people from the cottages had gathered
about Bihari and his band. She grasped the
sleeve of a tall young man to say in a low,
agitated tone, &ldquo;Do you know what schooner
that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schooner?&rdquo; He smiled down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the one by that other dock. Over&mdash;why!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;it is gone! It was a
black schooner. But now it is not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall young man looked at her in a manner
that seemed to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been seeing
things.&rdquo; This embarrassed her, so she lost
herself in the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>But not for long. One moment, and a pleasing
voice was saying in her ear, &ldquo;And are you
the golden-haired gypsy who will dance with
the bear tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />THE HEAD HUNTER</h2>
<p>When the searchlight from the water
had been switched off, Florence saw
the dark gray power boat approaching the
camping ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greta,&rdquo; she groaned, &ldquo;we should have gone
up the ridge at once! There&rsquo;s no peace or privacy
anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boat came nearer they read in large
letters across the prow one word, &ldquo;CONSERVATION.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brought momentary relief to the startled
girls. Conservation men are government
men and these, Florence believed, could be
trusted.</p>
<p>Pulling in close to shore, the boat dropped
anchor. A sturdy, sun-tanned man leaped into
the small boat they had in tow, and rowed
rapidly toward land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the man who went into the bush
just now?&rdquo; he demanded the instant his feet
touched land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&mdash;man?&rdquo; Florence stammered. &ldquo;There
is no man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; the newcomer grumbled. &ldquo;There
was one, though. Don&rsquo;t try to deceive me! I
saw him! He&rsquo;s short, stoutly built, rather
dark, with a week&rsquo;s beard. Now then! Does
that convince you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence found her knees trembling.
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;these Conservation
men have saved us from trouble without knowing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;I believe you are telling
the truth. You did see a man. But&mdash;but
he doesn&rsquo;t belong to us. Truly he does not!
Wait! I&rsquo;ll tell you about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about yourself first. What are you
doing here?&rdquo; The man did not smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;&rdquo; Florence was
greatly disturbed. &ldquo;We came over here from
the wreck. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; her inquisitor broke in as a smile
overspread his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the girls living
out there on the wreck. That&mdash;er&mdash;I owe you
an apology. We&rsquo;ve heard of you. You&rsquo;re O. K.
You see, we&rsquo;re the Conservation men on the
island, Dick and I. Got to see that no game
is killed, no trees cut, no fires started, all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me now&mdash;&rdquo; His voice took on an
eager note. &ldquo;Tell me about that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence told him all she knew. He was,
she felt quite certain, the man who had intended
murdering Old Uncle Ned, the veteran
moose, and the man who had fought with her
that battle of oars. She trembled now as she
thought what might have happened had not
these Conservation men happened along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God seems to be keeping an eye on us,&rdquo;
she was to say to Jeanne some time later. And
Jeanne was to reply reverently, &ldquo;He notes the
sparrow&rsquo;s fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; the Conservation man said
when the story was done. &ldquo;My name is Mell.
As man to man, I&rsquo;d like to shake your hand.
The way you saved the old moose was keen.
You&rsquo;re the right sort. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get you a job
on our force.&rdquo; He shook her hand warmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this fellow&mdash;&rdquo; his brow wrinkled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to look after him. He&rsquo;s a head
hunter, beyond a doubt. Fellow can get good
money for a fine pair of moose antlers. These
rascals come over here and kill our best friends
of the wildwood, just for a few sordid dollars.
Watch us go after him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping into his boat, he was away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; Florence was enthusiastic.
&ldquo;Question is, shall we camp here or
try a return trip to the ship?&rdquo; For a moment
all thoughts of the treasure hunt were forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moon will be out by ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she said
after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Be safer on the
water then. We&rsquo;ll make a fire and have something
to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Their evening lunch over, the girls curled
up side by side with the wall of their small
tent at their back and the glowing fire before
them. All about them was blackness. Not a
gleam came from the surface of dark waters.
Not a break appeared in the wall of bottle-green
that was the forest at their back. For
all this, they were not afraid. Swen&rsquo;s rifle lay
across Florence&rsquo;s knees. Their ears were keen.
No intruder could slip upon them unannounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; Greta whispered. &ldquo;We found a tiny
bit. I wonder if there can be much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Florence murmured dreamily.</p>
<p>Presently the big girl&rsquo;s head fell forward.
She slept, as the wild people before her had
slept, sitting before the fire.</p>
<p>Greta did not wake her. &ldquo;I will hear in time
if there is any danger,&rdquo; she told herself. She
liked the feel of it all, the warmth of the fire
on her face, the little breezes playing in her
hair, her sleeping comrade, the night, the mysterious
forest&mdash;all this seemed part of a new
world to her. She smiled as she thought of
her own soft bed at home with its bright covers
and downy pillow. &ldquo;Who would wish to
live like that always?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;Who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Her thoughts snapped off like a radio singer
who had been cut off. Wind was beginning to
come down the bay and, wafted along by it
was a sound, faint, indistinct but unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The phantom violin!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>This time the sound came from so great a
distance that it was but a teasing phantom of
sound.</p>
<p>She wanted to slip away into the forest and
follow the sound. But she dared not.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Petite Jeanne was with her wild, free friends
of other days. In the pale light of Japanese
lanterns she danced with the bear the old fantastic
dances of those other days. When it
was over and she passed the tambourine for
Bihari, a great weight of silver coins thumped
into it. For a moment she was deliriously happy.
When it was all over and she had rowed
alone in a small boat out to the center of the
narrow bay, her feelings changed. For one
short moment she wished herself back on the
wreck with Florence and Greta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not!&rdquo; She pulled herself up
short. &ldquo;Bihari and his people have done much
for me. I must not fail them now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! But this is beautiful!&rdquo; she breathed a
moment later. &ldquo;And I shall see it all&mdash;all this
marvelous island!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene before her was like some picture
taken from a fairy book. A dark circle of forest
with only a pale light gleaming here and
there like a star, and at the center of all this
the lights of a long, low room casting mellow
reflections upon the water.</p>
<p>Figures moved about like gay phantoms in
this light. To her ears came the low melody
of guitar and violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so beautiful!&rdquo; She felt her throat
tighten with the joy of it all. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of the black schooner that
had slipped away into the great unknown lying
away beyond the shrouds of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The diver was on that schooner,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;What if they return to our
home, our poor wrecked ship! They may set
fire to it! They may blow it up with dynamite!&rdquo;
She shuddered. &ldquo;They came there to
look for something. I wonder what it could
be? Florence is a famous diver. When we
are back at the wreck&mdash;if we ever are,&rdquo; she
murmured dreamily, &ldquo;she shall dive into that
place and see. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But someone was calling her name. She
must return to the shore. Her brief hour of
revery was at an end.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>On the camping grounds at Duncan&rsquo;s Bay
for two hours Florence slept. When she woke
the moon was out. The wind too had risen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waves will be too high,&rdquo; was her instant
decision. &ldquo;We must stay here for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tomorrow,&rdquo; Greta whispered eagerly,
&ldquo;tomorrow at dawn we will go up the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta told of hearing that faint thread of
music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said Florence, and began
preparation for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Their tent was small, only seven feet square.
It had a floor of canvas. Once inside with the
flap buttoned tight, they were as securely
housed as the caterpillar in his chrysalis.</p>
<p>Greta was not slow in creeping down among
the blankets. She went to sleep at once.</p>
<p>As for Florence, she drew on her heavy
sweater, thrust her feet under the blankets,
propped the rifle against the tent wall and,
folding her arms across her knees, sat at half
watch the night through.</p>
<p>The sun had not cleared the tree tops when
the Conservation boat appeared. It had a
small black power boat in tow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited for him all night, that head
hunter,&rdquo; Mell explained. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t show up.
Hoofed it back into the hills, I guess. The
boat was stolen. We&rsquo;re taking it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good, his hiding in the forest,&rdquo; he concluded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him, you&rsquo;ll see. Tell every
ship captain to watch for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Florence when they were
gone, &ldquo;that they get him very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, with packs on their backs,
the two girls headed up the rocky slope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure hunt can wait,&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;We can go after that when Jeanne
is back. Now we&rsquo;re going to explore Greenstone
Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This course, she had thought during the
night, might seem a bit dangerous with the
head hunter still at large. &ldquo;But the ridge is a
trackless wilderness,&rdquo; she had reassured herself.
&ldquo;He will never come upon our trail.&rdquo;
Which, as you will see by what follows, was a
fair conclusion.</p>
<p>The events that followed the climbing of
Greenstone Ridge on that bright and beautiful
day were strange beyond belief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />SECRET OF GREENSTONE RIDGE</h2>
<p>Late next afternoon the <i>Ship of Joy</i> with
Bihari and his band, including Jeanne and
the bear, went gliding down the long, narrow
stretch of water known as Rock Harbor. As
Jeanne, seated in a sunny spot on the deck,
watched the small island to the left go gliding
by, she felt, as one feels the current of galvanic
electricity go coursing through his system,
the thrill and mild terror that comes
when one senses impending adventure, terror,
or disaster. She could not tell what was to
happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something will happen,&rdquo; a voice seemed
to whisper. &ldquo;You are coming nearer and
nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not doubt the voice. It had come to
her before. Such is the gift of wandering people;
they feel and know in advance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>No, she did not doubt. And yet, the low sun
shone so mildly, waves lapped the boat&rsquo;s sides
so dreamily, islands of green and brown glided
by so like drifting shadows, she forgot all
else and, stretching out upon the deck, she surrendered
herself to the spell of it all.</p>
<p>Not for long. A chill wind came sweeping
over the tops of the islands. Dark clouds scurried
overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is bad!&rdquo; Bihari grumbled. &ldquo;Our next
stop is Chippewa Harbor. We must go out into
the lake to get there. Lake Superior is bad
when he is angry. He puts out hands and
seizes small boats. He drags them down and
they are never seen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Chippewa Harbor there are little cabins
and just now a large party camping in tents.
We will sing and dance for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tomorrow&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed a large,
good-natured laugh. &ldquo;Tomorrow. We have
with us always tomorrow. That will do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this harbor we are safe. Tonight we
will sing for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>He was right. When at last they reached
the narrow passage through which they were
to glide into broad, open waters, they saw an
endless field of black and white, a stormy sea.</p>
<p>Pulling in behind a small island where the
wind could not reach them and the water was
at rest, they dropped anchor and at once the
gypsy band were engaged in a merry and
quite innocent revel of wild music.</p>
<p>Jeanne did not join them. Had one asked
her why, she perhaps could not have told. She
thought of Florence and Greta, wondered if
they were at the wreck or on land, wondered,
too, how the wreck would stand the storm.
She thought of friends in Chicago and her
castle in France where her great-aunt saw to
it that she lived up to her position as a great
young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is strange. We long
for the past. And when we find it again, we
are not sure that we want it. Life, it seems,
goes on and on, but never truly backward. We
must go on and on with it to the end. And
then&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but life is truly wonderful!&rdquo; she cried,
springing to her feet and doing a wild fling
across the deck. &ldquo;Who would not love to live
on and on and on forever!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped as if in
a prayer. &ldquo;Perhaps we shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s soul was like a day of clouds and
sunshine, a change with every tick of the
clock.</p>
<p>Next instant she had caught sight of a tall,
narrow tower rising above a low building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The abandoned lighthouse!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;That is where our good friend the fisher boy,
Swen, lives. He told me he had his home with
his father and mother in that tower. What an
odd home it must be! No corners in the rooms
at all. Oh, I must see it and our good friend
Swen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Next instant she sprang into a boat bumping
at the side of the schooner, untied the rope,
seized the oars and rowed away alone. Even
as she did this there came over her again that
sense of impending danger.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Greenstone Ridge, like the backbone of a
very lean horse, runs the entire length of Isle
Royale. The crest of that ridge may be
reached only by climbing a very steep slope.
This climb is broken by narrow plateaus.
When Florence and Greta had reached the
first plateau they turned their backs upon that
end of the island that was known to them and
headed straight on into the great unknown.</p>
<p>They came at once upon a well-trodden
moose trail. Hundreds of moose wander from
end to end of this strange island. This trail
made travel easy. Moss soft as carpet, bits of
soft wood beaten into pulp, with here and
there a stretch of black earth or gray rock,
offered pleasant footing for their patiently
plodding feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop at noon,&rdquo; Florence said. &ldquo;Have
a cold lunch and a good rest. We&rsquo;ll travel some
more after that. When we&rsquo;re tired we&rsquo;ll find
a big flat rock, build a fire, make hot chocolate,
fry bacon, have a real feast. Then the
tent and blankets. We&rsquo;ll be living where no
one has lived, explorers. Won&rsquo;t it be grand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Greta had thought it might be. She did not
feel quite sure. Pictures of her own safe bed,
of a table spread with snowy linen and shining
silver, floated before her eyes. &ldquo;If mother
could see me now!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oh, it is good to breathe&mdash;just
breathe!&rdquo; Throwing back her shoulders, she
drank in a breath of air that was like water,
clear and cold from a deep well.</p>
<p>On this long tramp Florence led the way.
Never a person who would waste breath with
idle talk on such an occasion, she plodded
along in silence. For all that, her active brain
was busy. She was thinking through a very
special and private interview she had had with
Swen the fisher boy only three days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going way back up yonder?&rdquo;
He had waved a sun-browned arm toward the
distant ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence had caught her breath.
&ldquo;Yes, we are going up there. Won&rsquo;t it be
gr-a-a-nd! They say no one goes up there&mdash;that
perhaps no one has ever been up there.
It must be lonely, silent, beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all of that.&rdquo; The fisherman&rsquo;s blue eyes
were frank and kind. &ldquo;But I thought I&rsquo;d ought
to tell you, just in case you don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s
someone waiting for you up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The girl spoke quickly. &ldquo;No, there is
no one at all. We are going by ourselves, just
Greta and I. We sent no one ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; Swen replied. &ldquo;All the
same, there&rsquo;s someone up there. I&rsquo;ll tell you
how I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to collect his thoughts, he had paused,
looking away at Greenstone Ridge. Florence
recalled that now.</p>
<p>It was worth looking at, that ridge. In truth,
every little corner of this large island was
worth looking at.</p>
<p>Just then the setting sun had transformed
the far-away green of spruce and balsam into
a crown of green and gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I know there&rsquo;s someone
up there,&rdquo; Swen went on presently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
a little store down by the end of the harbor.
Four times that store has been entered.
Things have been taken. Not stolen; just
taken and the money left to pay for them. The
first three times it was food they took. The
last time it was a grinding stone for polishing
greenstone. Cost me five dollars. The five
was there. Can you beat that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your store is on the other side of the
island,&rdquo; Florence had protested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another
place entirely. We&rsquo;re not going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same ridge,&rdquo; Swen explained,
patiently. &ldquo;When you come to the tip-top of
the ridge and if you go far enough toward the
center of the island&mdash;not so far, either&mdash;you
can look down on Duncan&rsquo;s Bay on your side
and upon our harbor on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And up there somewhere,&rdquo; he added with
conviction, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s someone. I know it! He
took things from our store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence had thought of Greta&rsquo;s phantom.
Could it be that there truly was someone living
on this ridge? And would they discover
that person?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pays for things he takes. He is honest,&rdquo;
she argued to herself. &ldquo;He loves music.
No true musician could be unkind or brutal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all,&rdquo; she had insisted, turning
her face to Swen, &ldquo;after all, there is no one.
A boat came along at night. The people in
the boat took the things from your store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came in a boat, that&rsquo;s what I thought at
first.&rdquo; The light of mystery shone in the fisherman&rsquo;s
eye. &ldquo;But the last time, that time he
took the grinding wheel and left the five dollars
in gold, there was a storm on old Superior,
a terrible nor-easter. No one could have lived
in that sea. And there wasn&rsquo;t so much as a
rowboat in the harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that person don&rsquo;t live on the shore,
either,&rdquo; he went on after a moment. &ldquo;Know
every boat of the shore, I do. Naturally, then,
they&rsquo;re up there on Greenstone Ridge somewhere,
someone is, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how long ago?&rdquo; The words had
stuck in Florence&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time was all of a year ago. Last
time, early this spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then perhaps he&rsquo;s gone. This is
August, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, miss. Somehow I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why would anyone stay a whole year in
such a place? Think what it would mean!&rdquo;
Her eyes had opened wide. &ldquo;No companions!
No food except what you have taken up. All
alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re assuming there&rsquo;s only one. I don&rsquo;t
know. There might be more. Articles have
been found missing from cottages closed for
the winter, food and clothing. Always paid for,
though. One fisherman, who was very poor,
found the price of three pairs of boots left for
one pair; well-worn ones they were, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do they stay up there?&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your question. Perhaps you will find
the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;why haven&rsquo;t you been up there to
see?&rdquo; Florence asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? See here, miss, I&rsquo;m a fisherman&mdash;belong
to the water. No land lubberin&rsquo; for mine!
And besides, I&rsquo;ve a father and mother to look
after. I got my money for the things he took,
didn&rsquo;t I? Then what call do I have looking
into places like that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Once again the girl had looked away to the
place where the ridge must be. It was gone,
swallowed up in the night. Not a light had
shone up there. Not a campfire gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one up there,&rdquo; she had whispered
to herself as she stood alone on the deck
of the wrecked ship, straining her eyes for
even a very small gleam against the sky.
&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be. They&rsquo;d have a lamp of some
sort, even if it were only a pine knot torch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she had thought of the
curious green light Greta had seen at a distance
on that very ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have caused that light?&rdquo; she
had asked herself.</p>
<p>She asked it all over again as she trudged
away over the moose trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the head
hunter. But he&rsquo;s out. Such men don&rsquo;t climb
ridges unless they&rsquo;re obliged to&mdash;too lazy for
that! And they don&rsquo;t make divine music nor
light green lamps at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she whispered to herself after
a time, &ldquo;suppose I should have told Greta
what Swen said, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Well, she just hadn&rsquo;t wanted to, that was
all. Perhaps she had been selfish, she had
wanted this trip so much. She had wanted
company too. And too much talk about the
secrets of Greenstone Ridge might have
frightened Greta out altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why they call this Greenstone
Ridge?&rdquo; she said aloud to Greta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there is a kind of quartz embedded
in some of the rocks. They call these greenstones.
They are about the seventh most valuable
stone in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we find some?&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s tone was
eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope so.&rdquo; Florence shifted her pack.
&ldquo;They make grand settings for rings, things
like that. You chip them from the rocks with
a chisel or hatchet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green stones,&rdquo; Greta whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Green stone and a green light on this very
ridge. Of course, there&rsquo;s no connection; but
then, it&rsquo;s sort of strange.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />A LEAP IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s row from the <i>Ship of Joy</i> to the
small dock before the ancient lighthouse
was a short one. Her boat tied up, she hurried
along the dock, then over the winding
path leading up the gentle slope.</p>
<p>Darkness was falling. Even now, from the
schooner&rsquo;s cabin she caught a yellow gleam
of light. She cast a hurried glance toward the
tall stone tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They live up there somewhere,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She quickened her step. &ldquo;Soon be dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hesitating before a door, she took a grip
on herself, then seized the doorknob and gave
it a quick turn. The door flew open. Silence,
the faint smell of smoked fish and half darkness
greeted her. She was at the foot of a
winding stairway. She sprang forward and
up. At the top of that stairway was a second
door. It stood ajar. She rapped on it. No
answer. A louder rap. Still no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just make sure.&rdquo; She pushed the door
open. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;someone lives
here, some old people who love comfort, chairs
and soft, home-made cushions and all that.
Dear old people they must be. And there,
there&rsquo;s a rag doll! Must be children, too.
Swen never spoke of them. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was beginning to think she had come
to the wrong lighthouse when a sound from
the stairs caused her to start violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Her voice shook
ever so slightly.</p>
<p>There came no answer. Instinctively the
girl sprang toward the center of this tower
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Perhaps this movement saved her. As she
whirled about she saw to her horror that there,
standing in the doorway, was the head hunter.
She had not seen him before, but from Florence&rsquo;s
description she knew she could not be
mistaken. There was the same short, stout
body, the dark, evil face, the blood-shot eyes.
That he recognized her as Florence&rsquo;s friend
she could not doubt. There was a look of savage
glee in his eyes. His yellow teeth showed
like fangs.</p>
<p>For a space of seconds the little French
girl stood paralyzed with fear. Then as her
eyes circled the room they caught sight of a
second door. She sprang toward this.</p>
<p>The door swung open and banged shut.
Like a flash she was away up a second flight
of stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This leads to the top of the tower,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;And when I&rsquo;m out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bat, frightened from the beams, flashed
by her, another, and still another. She hated
and feared bats. But a greater terror lay behind.
There came the sound of heavy steps.</p>
<p>Darkness lay before her. &ldquo;A trap door.&rdquo;
Her frightened mind recorded these words.
&ldquo;What if it is locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not locked. She was through it. It
slammed behind her. There was no lock on
that side. What was to be done?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Two heavy stones on the ledge beside her
seemed loose. They <i>were</i> loose. Pushing more
than lifting, she banged one down upon the
door, then the other. She caught the sound
of muttered curses as the second stone banged
down.</p>
<p>Safe for the moment, she considered her
next move. That the man would, in time, be
able to wreck that door she did not doubt.
&ldquo;Sure to be an axe down there,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Wildly her eyes searched the circular platform.
In an obscure spot she saw a coil of
rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stout,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;but too short.
Never reach the ground.&rdquo; Dizzily she surveyed
the scene below. Beneath her for the
most part were rocks. Between these were
narrow patches of grass. &ldquo;Nice place to land!&rdquo;
she grumbled.</p>
<p>To the right and some twenty feet from the
tower was a huge fir tree. In her distress she
fancied that its branches reached out to her,
offering aid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>Seizing the rope, she tied one end to a beam,
then leaning far out, watched the other end
drop as it unfolded coil by coil. This came
to an end at last. &ldquo;Still thirty feet,&rdquo; she
thought with fresh panic. &ldquo;Be killed sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing quite still, she listened. There
came no sound. &ldquo;Gone down. May not come
back.&rdquo; She uttered a low prayer.</p>
<p>She was thinking now, wondering how this
man had come here, all the way across the
ridge from Duncan&rsquo;s Bay. &ldquo;Probably someone
was after him. Should be,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Came here to escape. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking in upon her thoughts came a terrific
crash. A blow had been aimed at the trap
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got an axe. Door won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo; She was half
way over the ledge. Ten seconds later, bracing
her feet against the wall, she was going
down the rope hand over hand.</p>
<p>The end? She reached that soon enough.
Still thirty feet above the earth, she clung
there motionless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Then of a sudden, taking a strong grip on
the rope, she began working her way back,
round the tower. When she had gone as far
as she dared, she gave a quick, strong push
and set herself swinging wide.</p>
<p>With a sort of pumping motion, aided by
an occasional kick at the wall, she was able
to get herself into a wide swing. Then of a
sudden, with a quick intake of breath, she
let go.</p>
<p>She fell, as she had hoped to do, squarely
into the arms of the friendly fir tree. She
caught at its branches, swayed forward, held
her grip, shifted her feet, then sank to a deep,
dark corner where, for the moment, she might
rest and gain control of her wildly beating
heart.</p>
<p>Ten seconds later there came a low swish.
That was the falling rope. The head hunter
had cut it. At thought of what might have
happened, the girl all but lost her balance.</p>
<p>A moment later, after a hasty scramble, she
reached earth and went swiftly away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>With hands scratched, dress torn and heart
beating wildly, she reached the dock, raced
along on tip-toe, dragged the tie rope free,
dropped into her boat, then rowed rapidly and
silently away.</p>
<p>Arrived at the side of the <i>Ship of Joy</i>, she
drew her boat into its protective shadows to
sit there watching, listening, waiting motionless.</p>
<p>From the shore there came a sound. It was
strange. She could not interpret it. In time
it died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should tell Bihari all about it,&rdquo;
she thought soberly. Still she did not move.
She respected and loved the gallant gypsy
chief; but most of all she feared his terrible
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she thought with a shudder, &ldquo;is no
time for battle and bloodshed.&rdquo; Her eyes were
fixed upon the dark masses of Greenstone
Ridge. The moon in all its golden glory had
just risen over that ridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>On that ridge at this moment, had she but
known it, sat two silent watchers, Florence
and Greta. Had they been possessed of a powerful
searchlight and an equally powerful telescope,
they might have looked down from
their lofty throne upon the little French girl
seated there in the boat.</p>
<p>As Jeanne sat there a curious sound struck
her ear. &ldquo;Like someone swimming,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Surely that terrible man would not
think of attempting that! He knows Bihari&rsquo;s
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat motionless, listening, ready to
spring up and flee, while the sound grew louder.
Then of a sudden she gave vent to a low
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bear!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bear.&rdquo; Her tone was suddenly sober.
&ldquo;He has been on shore. What has he seen?
What has he done?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; She rose as, without seeing her, the
bear tumbled clumsily over the schooner&rsquo;s rail.
&ldquo;Whatever he knows, he never will tell. That&rsquo;s
where a bear makes one fine friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />GRETA&rsquo;S SECRET</h2>
<p>That night the dark-eyed Greta found
herself in the midst of a nature lover&rsquo;s
paradise. Yet she was not at that moment
thinking of any paradise. She was listening
with all her ears, listening to the sounds of
the night, waiting, too, for some other sound
that she hoped might come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it play tonight,&rdquo; she whispered to herself,
&ldquo;the phantom violin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That her ear might catch the faintest sound,
she was sitting up in bed. And such a sweet-scented
bed as it was! Blankets spread over
nature&rsquo;s thick mattress of dry moss and balsam
tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I forget and fall asleep,&rdquo; she
asked herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Once again she leaned forward to listen.
&ldquo;How sweet!&rdquo; she murmured as she caught
the night call of some small bird, a single long-drawn
note. &ldquo;Just a call in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, muscles tense, ears strained, she
sat erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No bird this time, no single note, but many
notes. Yet it was all so indistinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The phantom violin!&rdquo; Her lips trembled.
&ldquo;Like the singing of angels!&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now it has faded away.&rdquo; Regret
was registered in her tone.</p>
<p>Once again she crept under the blankets to
the warm spot at Florence&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>They had come far that day, with pack on
back over rough moose trails. The stalwart
Florence had carried the heaviest load. Now,
oblivious to all about her, she slept the deep
sleep of one possessed of a clear head and a
healthy body.</p>
<p>The spot they had chosen for their night
camp was down from the very crest of Greenstone
Ridge but a dozen paces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Greta was very weary. They had traveled
farther that day than had been their intention.
There were no fit camping places along the
moose trail. At last, just as shadows were
falling, they had decided to climb to the crest,
a hard task for the day&rsquo;s end. They had made
it, for all that. And on the far side of that
ridge they had discovered the very spot. A
flat rock, some twenty feet across, offered
support for an improvised hearth of stones. A
mossy bed above this invited them to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of wind. No rain tonight,&rdquo; had been
Florence&rsquo;s prophecy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just make our
bed beneath the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, here they were, and here was Greta,
sitting up, wide awake, dreaming in the night.</p>
<p>Florence had known Greta for only a short
time. The true nature of this dark-eyed girl
was for the most part as yet to her a veiled
secret. She did not know that the nature of
these slender, black-eyed ones often drives
them unflinching into places of great peril,
that roused by anger or intrigued by mystery
they will dare all without one backward look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>The story Swen had told Florence could
not have frightened Greta from taking a part
in this great adventure. Truth was, she knew
it all, and more. She treasured a secret all her
own, did this dark-eyed girl. She was thinking
of it now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He called them white flares,&rdquo; she murmured
low. &ldquo;Said if we were in grave danger
or needed help in any way, to light one of
them. He would see the white light against
the sky and come. Vincent Stearns said that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had met Vincent Stearns, a sturdy, sun-tanned
young man, a famous newspaper camera
man, at Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor only two days before.
Swen had taken her to the Harbor in
his fishing boat. On the way he had told her
of the mysterious someone who, he was sure,
lived on Greenstone Ridge. She had repeated
the story to Vincent Stearns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the photographer had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard the story myself. So you are going up
there on a camping trip&mdash;just two girls?&rdquo; He
had arched his brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you should see Florence!&rdquo; Greta
had exclaimed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s big as a man and
strong! You can&rsquo;t know how strong she is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he had insisted, &ldquo;you may
find yourself in need of help. Take these. They
are white flares. If you need help, set one on
a flat rock atop the ridge and set it off. I use
&rsquo;em for taking pictures of moose at night. It
can be seen for miles, that white light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be hunting moose with a camera
on the lakes near the far end of Rock Harbor.
Wherever you are, if I see that flare I&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta had accepted the white flares. They
were in her kit bag now. &ldquo;Not that we&rsquo;ll need
them. But then, you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After listening a long time for the return of
the bewitching phantom music, she cuddled
down and fell asleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was at about this same hour that Jeanne,
looking from her porthole in the <i>Ship of Joy</i>,
watching the brown old lighthouse tower that
stood all dark in the moonlight, saw at one of
the windows a wavering light. This was followed
by a steady yellow gleam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Is that
truly Swen&rsquo;s home? And has he returned?
Or is that the head hunter making himself
comfortable for the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more problem returned to her before
she fell asleep. The bear had been to the mainland.
Doubtless he had missed her and had
followed by swimming. He had not, however,
returned for some time. What had he done
there on land?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably nothing,&rdquo; she told herself. She
could not be sure, however.</p>
<p>In the morning she was to learn much and
wonder still more.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Greta had not slept long before she found
herself once more wide awake, staring up at
the fleeing clouds. &ldquo;Something must have disturbed
my dreams,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What
can it have been?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Then, as minds have a way of doing, her
mind took up an old, old problem and thought
it all through again. This problem had to do
with her future. A very rich woman had
heard her playing the violin in a very small
concert. She had, as she had expressed it, been
&ldquo;charmed, charmed indeed,&rdquo; by Greta&rsquo;s modest
efforts. She had offered to become her
good angel, had this very rich and rather pompous
lady. &ldquo;You shall study at my expense,
under the very great masters,&rdquo; she had said.
&ldquo;No expense shall be spared. And in time&mdash;&rdquo;
her bulging eyes had glowed. &ldquo;In time you
shall have the world at your feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta had not said &ldquo;I will do it.&rdquo; Instead,
she had replied, &ldquo;I must talk it over with my
mother. I will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still &ldquo;seeing.&rdquo; This was one of the
problems yet to be solved. She did long to
study under great masters. And yet, she loved
her own family. She wished that they might
do for her all that was grand and glorious.
&ldquo;To invite a rich stranger into one&rsquo;s life,&rdquo;
some wise person had said to her, &ldquo;is often to
shut one&rsquo;s humble friends out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The world at my feet,&rdquo; she repeated, then
laughed softly to herself. Beneath them, rolling
away like billows of the sea, was the glorious
green of that primeval forest; and beyond
that, black and mysterious in the night,
lay the waters of Lake Huron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world at my feet! I have that tonight!&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat straight up to listen. The wind had
changed. It was rising. The right side of their
tent was sagging. Borne in on this wind, the
sound that had puzzled her before came
sweeping in like the notes of some long forgotten
song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana!&rdquo;
Her astonishment knew no bounds. Surely
there <i>was</i> someone on Greenstone Ridge!
Someone who played the violin divinely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought more soberly, &ldquo;in
this still air sound carries far. May be on some
boat out there on the black waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peering into the night she strained her
eyes in a vain attempt to discover a light on
the lake. There was no light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>She had just snuggled down in her warm
corner once more when every muscle of her
supple form stiffened in terror. She sprang to
her feet. From some distant spot, yet startling
in its distinctness, had come one wild, piercing
scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what could that have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping at her heart to still its mad beating,
she sank back in her place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo! How cold!&rdquo; She drew the blankets
about her.</p>
<p>Her mind was in a turmoil. Who had
screamed? That it was a person, not some
wild creature, she could not doubt. But who?</p>
<p>Should she waken Florence? Her hand was
on the big girl&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she
asked herself. &ldquo;We are two girls. What can
we do in the night on a ridge we do not know?
Fall into a crevice. No help to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again she crawled down beneath the
blankets. Once more she caught the notes of
that mysterious music. It had not stopped.
Plainly that person was not associated in any
way with the scream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The wind began whispering in the pines.
The sound blended with that strange music.
Together they became the accompaniment to
a dream. She slept. And still at her feet lay
the glorious little world that is Isle Royale.</p>

<br />THE CAVERN OF FIRE</h2>
<p>Not until her courage had been strengthened
by a steaming cup of coffee
brewed over a fire before the tent was Greta
ready to tell her companion of the mysterious
sounds in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a crazy old loon,&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s
prompt solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A loon may be a bright bird,&rdquo; Greta said
laughingly, with the light of day terror had
vanished, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve never known a loon that
can play the Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo; Florence threatened
her mockingly with her sheath knife. &ldquo;It
was a loon that screamed. They&rsquo;re very human
at times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not as human as that cry in the night,&rdquo; the
slender girl affirmed with conviction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
never rest until I&rsquo;ve solved the mystery of
that cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence scrambled to her feet. &ldquo;In that
case, we&rsquo;d better get at its solving at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s tone was sober. &ldquo;What
would be your reply if right out of the blue a
very rich woman would say to you: &lsquo;You have
a wonderful future. I will help you, give you
money, all you need. You shall study under
the great masters. In time you shall be greater
than them all.&rsquo; What would you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d probably say &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose you felt that accepting such
an offer would put you in her power. Supposing
you had always wanted to be free&mdash;free
as a bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Florence spoke slowly. &ldquo;Of
course in a way I know what you mean. I am
just a physical director. All day I put boys
and girls through their exercises, teach them
to play basketball and handball, instruct them
in swimming and all that. Very useful. Makes
&rsquo;em strong. But not quite like music, don&rsquo;t you
see? Perhaps a musician truly must be free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see. We must think our problems
through for ourselves, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s right. But come on! We&rsquo;re
off in search of a scream.&rdquo; Seizing a stout
walking stick, Florence prepared to lead the
way into the great unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said there are greenstones to be found
right up here in the rocks.&rdquo; Greta studied a
massive boulder of greenish hue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence produced a chisel and a
small hammer. &ldquo;Swen gave me these. They
chisel the stones right out of the rocks. I saw
one a lady down at Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor had set
in a cameo ring, a beauty. Worth quite a lot,
I guess. Well, I hope to find a number as good
as that. What grand Christmas presents
they&rsquo;d make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; Greta came to a sudden halt.
&ldquo;Swen said someone took an emery wheel for
grinding greenstones from his store. Do you
suppose someone is up here hunting greenstones?
And do you think he could have fallen
off into a chasm or something last night?
Was it his scream I heard?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So Swen told you all about that?&rdquo; Florence
exclaimed. &ldquo;And yet you wanted to
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;wanted to come?&rdquo; Greta stared at her.
&ldquo;Surely! Why not? More than ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave little girl!&rdquo; Florence put a hand on
her shoulder. &ldquo;But that idea of yours about
the scream seems a bit fantastic. You never
can tell, though. But if he did fall in a crevice,
we&rsquo;d never find him, not up here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that ledge!&rdquo; She pointed away to
the right. &ldquo;Hundred feet high, half a mile
long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look down there.&rdquo; Her gaze swept
the tangled forests that lay below the narrow
plateau on which they stood. &ldquo;Just look!
Trees have been fighting for their lives there
a thousand years. Twisted, tangled, fallen,
grown over with bushes and vines. How is
one to conduct a search in such a place? Might
as well forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Greta sighed. Nevertheless,
she did not forget.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said a moment later,
&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;d rather sit by our campfire and
think than to go prowling round this ridge
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid? Afraid of meeting
some&mdash;someone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! Just footsore and weary
after yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose you are. Sorry.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s
tone changed. &ldquo;As for me, I&rsquo;m used to it. If
you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;m going on. I don&rsquo;t admit
the possibility of anyone ever having been here
before us. I mean to be an explorer. Were
there any celebrated women explorers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many, I&rsquo;m afraid. There&rsquo;s one in Chicago
who goes across Africa once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to explore. You watch
me!&rdquo; Florence laughed as she marched away
into the bush. Soon enough she was to discover
that her statement that no one had been
here before them was not well founded. A
rough and ready manner of discovery it was
to be, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Left to herself, Greta wandered back to
camp, found a few live coals which she fanned
into flame, added fresh fuel, brewed herself
a cup of black tea, then sat down to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she repeated reverently, &ldquo;&lsquo;from whence cometh
my help.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was to come of this venture? Would
she, like the prophets of old, find strength and
inspiration by her sojourn in the hills?</p>
<p>The morning had been chilly. A cold wind
swept in from black waters. But now the sun
was up. Gentle breezes, like fairies&rsquo; wings,
brushed her cheeks. On a level space beneath
her, thimbleberry blossoms lay like a blanket
of snow. Away to the right a rocky slope
flamed all golden with wild tiger lilies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a fire,&rdquo; she told herself, gazing
into her own half burned out campfire.</p>
<p>There was something about an open fire
that takes us back and back to days we have
never truly known at all, the days of our pioneer
ancestors.</p>
<p>To this slender girl on this particular morning
the crackle of the fire seemed a call from
some long-forgotten past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Their camp lay within the shadow of a great
rock. The fire whispered of good fellowship
and cheer. The day before had been a long
one. Her muscles were still stiff from that
long tramp. As she sat there gazing into the
narrow fiery chasm made by half burned logs,
she fell into a state of mind that might be
called a trance or half a dream.</p>
<p>As her eyes narrowed it seemed to her that
the fiery chasm expanded until at last it was
so high she might step inside if she willed to
do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So warm! So bright! So cheery!&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;One might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? With a startled scream
she sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! It was Florence!&rdquo; she cried
aloud.</p>
<p>Then, coming into full possession of her faculties,
she stood and stared.</p>
<p>At that moment, as if the show were ended,
the bits of burning wood crumbled into a heap.
The chasm of fire was no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>But what had she seen there? It was
strange. She had seen quite plainly there at
the center of the fiery circle the form of her
companion, Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence.&rdquo; She said the word softly. &ldquo;Of
course she was not there, not even her image
was there. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it is truly possible to hear another
think when she is far away? There are
cases on record when this has seemed to be
true. Mental telepathy they call it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that vision could have been a
warning?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place&mdash;&rdquo; she shuddered. &ldquo;It haunts
me. Let me get out into the sunlight!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she told herself soberly, &ldquo;if we
may not listen to our friends&rsquo; thoughts when
they are far away, at least God can whisper
them in our ear. With Him all things are
possible. I must try to find Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>With that she walked some distance along
the slope to at last vanish down a narrow
moose trail that passed between two black old
spruce trees.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Bihari and his band, with Petite Jeanne in
their midst, were having their breakfast coffee
on deck that morning, when a white-haired
youth came rowing alongside in a roughly
made fishing boat. Two small children rode
in the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swen!&rdquo; Jeanne cried joyously. &ldquo;So that <i>is</i>
your lighthouse! That is your home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Swen grinned broadly. &ldquo;Anyway, I
thought it was. Since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Swen!&rdquo; Jeanne broke in, &ldquo;you never
told me you were married. What beautiful
children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children beamed up at her. But not
Swen. He was blushing from ear to ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;My children! I
am but eighteen. What could you think?
They are not my children. They are my
brother&rsquo;s. Their home is in the cabin by the
lighthouse. And my home&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated,
looking from face to face as if trying to read
something there. &ldquo;The lighthouse, it is my
home. But someone, it seems, wants to tear
it up. What can I think?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I came home last night,&rdquo; he rushed
on, &ldquo;all is strange. The doorstep is broken.
My bench by the door, it is tipped over. There
are bits of cloth everywhere. And my axe, it
is thrown on the ground. In the tower it is no
better. The trap door, it is broken, stones are
thrown down and my rope, it is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For fully a moment, when he had finished,
Jeanne stared at him. Then, as in a dream,
she murmured, &ldquo;It was the bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Swen, &ldquo;it was not the bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up and have a cup of coffee,&rdquo; said
Jeanne. She had recovered some of her composure.
&ldquo;Bring those beautiful children. We
will have a romp with the bear. And then,
then I will help you solve your riddle.&rdquo; She
laughed a merry laugh.</p>

<br />AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ANCIENT MINE</h2>
<p>And what of Florence? For one thing, she
had made a marvelous discovery.</p>
<p>After leaving her companion, she had wandered
for two hours along Greenstone Ridge.
Here she paused to examine the surface of a
greenish wall of rock. There she drew a chisel
and small hammer from her knickers&rsquo; pocket
to drill away on a spot of green. And now,
with no thought of rock or greenstone treasure,
head down, deep in meditation, she wandered
along some moose trail.</p>
<p>On Isle Royale moose trails are everywhere,
so too are wild moose. Protected by
law from murderous hunters, they wander at
will from shore to shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>This girl, who appeared so much a part of
this rugged island, knew she might meet a
moose at any turn, yet she was not afraid.</p>
<p>It was during one of these periods of deep
thought that she struck her foot against some
solid object and all but fell forward on her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what was that?&rdquo; She turned about.
&ldquo;Only a rock. And&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent over to look more closely. An exclamation
of joy escaped her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hammer! An Indian hammer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once she was down on her knees tearing
away at the thick moss that on Isle Royale
hides many a secret.</p>
<p>That the history of this interesting island
goes far back of the time when the first white
trader saw it, she knew right well.</p>
<p>Back in the dim past Indian tribes fought
many a bloody battle over the copper of this
strange island. Here, as we have said before,
copper in solid masses might be found close
to the surface. Rich indeed was the tribe that
possessed copper for knives, beads, spear
points and arrow heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find something more,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>As she looked at the surface she had bared
she stared in surprise. She had uncovered a
mass of charcoal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet there can have been no forest fire.&rdquo;
She looked at the great two-foot-thick trunk
of a spruce tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Indian mine!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;They
built a fire on the surface, then dragged it
away to break hot rock with these stone hammers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scraped away the charcoal with a sharp
stick. As she did so something gave forth a
low clink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a coin, but a knife,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;An ancient copper knife! How perfect!&rdquo; It
was indeed a far more perfect specimen than
the one she had found on the camping ground.
She held the thin blade to the light. Dating
back beyond the days of the white man, it held
for her an indescribable charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole island is a treasure house. I&rsquo;ll
find another.&rdquo; Once more she prodded away
at the moss and charcoal. Not a second knife,
but a spear point greeted her excited vision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>She widened her search. Prying away at a
deep bed of moss, she tore it away in a yard-square
chunk. And there beneath it, grinning
and horrible, was a skull.</p>
<p>At that instant something stirred in the
brush above her. With a startled scream she
whirled about, took one step backward, lost
her balance and plunged downward.</p>
<p>She had gone over the ridge. For an instant
her heart was in her mouth; the next she realized
that the slope, which was not too steep,
ended in a second narrow plateau.</p>
<p>Struggling to break her downward plunge,
she grasped at a branch. The branch snapped
off. A trailing vine served her no better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;the end will come soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sooner than she thought. Just when she
was waiting the final bump that should announce
her arrival at the bottom, she dropped
a surprising distance straight down, glanced
to the right, slid some twenty feet, then
dropped again to land with such a rude shock
that for a full moment she lay there utterly
oblivious to her strange surroundings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>When at last she came to, and strove to discover
what had happened, she found herself
in a place of almost complete darkness. Only
straight above her, at what seemed an incredible
distance, a narrow crack of light shone.</p>
<p>She rose stiffly to feel of her bruises. &ldquo;None
fatal, I guess.&rdquo; She tried to face the situation
with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know where I am, but I&rsquo;ll not stay
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she believed in imps she might have
fancied one saying: &ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she stretched her hands above her head
to feel for some means of drawing herself up,
she found nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solid rock.&rdquo; For the first time she was truly
startled. Where was she? How was she to
escape?</p>
<p>Thrusting a hand in her pocket, she drew
out a box of safety matches. Having lighted
one, she looked about her. By the yellow light
she discovered several facts. This place had
been made by men. Holes had been drilled
in the rock. The rock had been blasted away.
At her feet were bits of greenish rock. This,
she found, was not rock, but pure copper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An abandoned copper mine! A white man&rsquo;s
mine!&rdquo; Her heart sank. Not one of these
mines had been worked for forty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get out of here some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She studied the rocky surface about her.
&ldquo;Might get a good foothold here and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The match flared out. She lit another.
&ldquo;Could get a handhold there, and there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She doubted her ability to make this perilous
ascent. She had been fortunate to escape
with no broken bones. Next time she might
fare badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might scream. No harm in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She screamed at the top of her voice and at
once felt better.</p>
<p>When, however, after a half hour&rsquo;s attempt
at scaling the rocky wall, she found herself at
the bottom with only fresh bruises to show
for her trouble, she was near to despair.</p>
<p>Then a curious thing happened. Some object
came bumping down the wall, which at
the upper end was not steep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rock broke loose.&rdquo; She dodged.</p>
<p>The thing struck her on the head. No rock.
It was soft.</p>
<p>Gropingly she felt for and found it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leather,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Some little
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lighting a match, she examined it. She had
just opened this blank book and was looking
at a picture between the pages, when of a sudden
her heart stood still.</p>
<p>Something was coming down the wall, not
bumping, but gliding.</p>
<p>As she waited breathless, her match burned
her fingers. And still there came that scraping,
gliding sound. Her match sputtered out.
She was in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&mdash;there it is,&rdquo; she breathed as she
pressed back against the wall. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was ready to scream with fright when
the real nature of that gliding thing came to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rope! A rope!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a
hoarse whisper. Then&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Greta! Greta! Are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer. The rope had ceased to glide.
All was still as the grave.</p>
<p>Her heart thumped madly. Who was up
there? Had the mystery man of Greenstone
Ridge come to her aid? Who was he? What
was he like? Why did he stay on the ridge?</p>
<p>Suddenly she found herself more afraid than
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to touch that rope.&rdquo; Her whisper
ended in tremor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I must!&rdquo;</p>

<br />MYSTERY FROM THE SKY</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne loved children. They
need not be dressed in silks. In truth,
she thought that Nelse and Freda, the tots
who had come with Swen, dressed as they
were in their quaint home-made garments,
were about the most fascinating creatures she
had seen in all the wide world. While Swen
enjoyed his coffee and told Bihari in an excited
manner of that which had happened at
his house during his absence on the evening
before, she led her two young friends to the
prow where the bear, like a huge dog, lay
sprawled out on the deck.</p>
<p>Seeing their eyes open big with wonder and
fear, she seized the bear by the paws, dragged
him to his feet, and led him across the deck
in a clumsy dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>In less time than it takes to tell it, they
were whirling about in a ring-around-a-rosy,
Nelse and Freda, Jeanne and the big brown
bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you stay here all through the cold winter?&rdquo;
she asked, when at last, quite exhausted,
they dropped in a pile on the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Nelse said cheerfully. &ldquo;There is
great fun! Snow for forts, ice for sliding.
Winter is grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no school!&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>They did not seem very sorry about this,
but Jeanne, recalling Swen&rsquo;s desire for a boat
that more money might be made by fishing
and that these little ones might go to the
mainland where there were schools, wished
harder than ever that Florence&rsquo;s dream of
finding a barrel of gold might come true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A barrel of gold!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What
a lot of gold that must be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of her castle in France and
almost wished she might spend it for these
bright-eyed little ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;one may not spend
a castle. And there is Great-Aunt Minyon
who would not allow me to spend a penny of
it, even if it were possible. No! No! We must
find our barrel of gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time there remained in the back of
the little French girl&rsquo;s head a question. &ldquo;What
did Swen mean when he said his doorstep had
been broken, his bench overturned and bits
of cloth scattered before his door? Just what
he said, to be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bear!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He was
on shore a long time. What did he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To these questions she was destined to find
no certain answer. When she had told Swen
her part of the story and together they had
searched the vicinity of Swen&rsquo;s strange home
for some clue as to the whereabouts of the
head hunter, they could arrive at no definite
conclusions regarding any part of the mysterious
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is sure,&rdquo; Swen declared at last.
&ldquo;We will not make him happy if he comes
about our place again! We do not wish our
moose killed, nor the good people who visit
our island disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>It did not seem probable that the man would
return to this spot. &ldquo;But where will we hear
of him next?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. She
thought of her two good pals up there somewhere
on the ridge, then of their deserted
home, the wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he belong to that black schooner with
the diver on board?&rdquo; she asked herself. She
did not think so. &ldquo;But what of that schooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She decided in the end to abandon the task
of solving mysteries and to give herself over,
for the time, to the wild care-free life of Bihari
and his band. For all that, as the <i>Ship of Joy</i>,
riding the long sweeping waves that follow
every storm, went plowing its way out of
Rock Harbor and into the open lake, this little
French girl sat upon the deck, staring at the
sky. Her eyes were seeing things in the clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A barrel of gold!&rdquo; she whispered. Then,
in a hoarse exclamation, &ldquo;How absurd! And
yet, one must dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime Greta, impelled by memory
of a strange vision seen in the cavern of fire,
had started out in search of her companion.
She found little to guide her on her way.
Florence had gone away to the right of their
camp. This much she knew; nothing more.</p>
<p>She had not proceeded far before she discovered
that the narrow plateau was a bewildering
labyrinth of trees, bushes, and rocks.
More than this, its surface was as irregular
as the face of the deep in time of storm. Here
it rose steep as a stairway, there sloped away
to end in a stretch flat as a floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never find her in such a place,&rdquo; she grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Florence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer save the long-drawn whistle of
a bird.</p>
<p>The silence and loneliness of the place began
to oppress her. The memory of that
scream in the night remained in her mind as
something distinct, sinister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could that have been?&rdquo; she asked
herself with a shudder. &ldquo;Why did they
scream? What could have happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Her mind was filled with pictures of crimes
committed in secret places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo; She paused to stamp her foot.
&ldquo;Nothing of importance will come of it. Mysteries
fade before the light of day. The sun
is shining. Why do I shudder? And for that
matter, why am I here at all? A vision brought
me here, a dream dreamed out by the fire.
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off short to listen. Faint and
from far away there came the drone of an airplane
motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amphibian from Houghton,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Wonder if it will come near?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every day in summer, sometimes two or
three times a day, this great bi-motored plane
brings passengers and sightseers to Isle Royale.
The moose feeding on grass at the bottom
of inland lakes have learned to glance up
at its approach, then go on with their feeding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>This girl thought little of an airplane&rsquo;s approach.
Indeed, she had all but forgotten it
when, as she reached a rocky space quite devoid
of trees and found herself in a position
to look down upon another plateau that lay
some two hundred feet below, she was made
doubly conscious of its presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&mdash;it&rsquo;s not the bi-motor at all!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some strange plane, all white,
and it&mdash;it&rsquo;s landing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively she drew back into the shadow.</p>
<p>On the surface of that other plateau she discovered
a narrow lake, little more than a pond
in size, but doubtless quite deep. It was on
this lake that the plane was about to land.
Having circled twice, it came swooping down
to touch the water gently, gracefully as some
wild migrating bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; she murmured in admiration.</p>
<p>But that was not all. She had assumed for
the moment that this was but a chance landing,
caused perhaps by motor trouble. That it
was not she was soon enough to know, for the
plane taxied toward a large clump of dark
spruce trees. And to the girl&rsquo;s astonishment
a narrow boat, painted the color of the water,
stole out from that shore to at last glide alongside
the now motionless plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sol&mdash;solitude!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;No one
up here. They told us that. And now look!
There must be a settlement. What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something strange was going on down
there. She crawled back among the pine
needles. Someone was being lifted out of the
plane and into the boat. Now the boat with
its apparently helpless burden was pulling for
the shore. Studying this shore for a space of
seconds, she thought she made out some sort
of lodge there among the trees.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded painfully. What was
this? A kidnaping? A murder? Strange doings!
Curious sort of place they had chosen
for it all!</p>
<p>She did not wait to see more. Gliding about
the pine tree, she headed straight for her own
camp; nor did she pause till the white of their
small tent showed through the trees.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>And Florence? At the very moment Greta
sighted their tent, she stood contemplating the
rope that had so miraculously come to her aid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Greta!&rdquo; she called once more, this time
softly. No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be Greta.&rdquo; She experienced a
wild flutter at her heart. &ldquo;We have no rope
like that. But who can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody waiting for you up
there.&rdquo; The words of the young fisherman
came back to her, this time with a force that
carried conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone up here,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;but
who, and why? What can that person be
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recalling the face in the little book, she
drew the book again from her pocket, struck
a match, then peered at the picture.</p>
<p>A youngish face topped by a mass of all but
white hair seemed to smile at her from the
book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man!&rdquo; She caught her breath. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
handsome. I never saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then realizing that she might be seen in
that circle of yellow light, she snuffed out the
match, snapped the book shut, then stood at
attention, listening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Aside from the long-drawn whistle of some
small bird, no sound reached her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no good in delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting her hand to the rope, she tested it.
&ldquo;Solid! Solid as the rock itself. Now! Up I
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was no weakling. Indeed she was
above all else a perfect physical being. No
cigarette had ever stained her lips. She had
lived clean. She had not neglected her physical
inheritance. Boating, swimming, hiking in
summer, skating and skiing in winter, kept
her ever at her best. A forty-foot climb up a
rope with a stone wall for footing was play.</p>
<p>She did not pause to tell herself how easy
it would be. A tight gripping at the rope, a
quick breath, a leap upward, and she was
away. Having scaled the steep portion, she
paused for a second breath, then raced upward
to find&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no one here!&rdquo; she breathed as her
keen eyes took in every detail, rock, bush, and
tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone heard me call. Came to my aid,
then vanished. How&mdash;how weird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if possessed by the idea that the place
might be haunted, leaving the rope as it hung,
she quickly lost herself on the hillside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where have you been?&rdquo; Greta demanded
as she at last hurried into camp.
&ldquo;Have&mdash;have you been in great peril?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence stared at her speechless. For a
full moment she could not speak. When she
found her voice she blurted out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean to tell me you lowered that rope,
then bolted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What rope?&rdquo; Greta stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rope in the old mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence burst out laughing. &ldquo;What a
world! You ask me if I have been in great
danger. I have. But, after all, you seem to
know nothing of it. How&mdash;how come?&rdquo; She
dropped to a place before the freshly kindled
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamed it, I guess,&rdquo; Greta replied slowly.
&ldquo;But please do tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will. But first&mdash;&rdquo; Florence drew the
small blank book from her pocket, opened it
to the place of the picture, then asked quietly,
&ldquo;Ever see him before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I&mdash;&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s face was a study.
&ldquo;Florence, where <i>did</i> you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came tumbling down into the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a touch of something akin to awe
in the slim girl&rsquo;s voice as she said hoarsely,
&ldquo;That is a picture of the most wonderful musician
I have ever heard. He plays the violin
with a touch almost divine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The violin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But, Florence&mdash;&rdquo; Greta leaned forward
eagerly. &ldquo;Tell me all about it. Tell me
what happened to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Florence had told her story Greta
sat for a long time staring at the fire. When
at last she spoke it was in a subdued and mellow
tone. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the
little book that lay open before them, &ldquo;is the
picture of Percy O&rsquo;Hara. Strange name for a
great musician. But the Irish, they say, have
musical souls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was more than three years ago that I
heard him play. It happened that I was with
one of his personal friends. After the concert
I was introduced to him. Can you imagine?&rdquo;
Her laugh was low and melodious. &ldquo;Actually
shook hands with him, the truly great O&rsquo;Hara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was a bit romantic. I was
young. He became my hero in a way. I tried
to keep track of his triumphs. But quite suddenly
his triumphs ceased to be. I heard nothing
about him. There was a rumor that he
had disappeared. What do you think could
have happened? Surely one who had entranced
thousands with his delirious music
would not voluntarily allow himself to be lost&mdash;lost
from the world that loves him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something terrible may have happened to
him.&rdquo; Florence was staring at the fire. &ldquo;Terrible
things do happen these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this picture?&rdquo; Greta whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably belongs to some ardent admirer
like yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But listen, Florence&mdash;&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s lips tightened,
a fresh light shone in her face. &ldquo;I too
have had an adventure, discovered a mystery.
There is a narrow lake off there to the right
and below us. A monoplane landed there today.
Someone was lifted from the plane into
a boat. They rowed to the shore where there
is some sort of lodge. What can that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as we are concerned,&rdquo; Florence responded
soberly, &ldquo;it seems to mean that we
should strike our tent and descend to less inhabited
regions where we can enjoy ourselves
in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave those people to go on with their
evil deeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they are evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would hide away up here if their purposes
were lawful? Think, Florence! They
may be kidnapers! That person may be a
victim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence, springing to her
feet, &ldquo;and they may be law-abiding citizens!
Come, you have given me the creeps. Besides,
I&rsquo;m starving. You get some bacon frying while
I start the coffee brewing. We&rsquo;ll eat. That
will brighten our horizon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock came. Seated before a fire of
brightly gleaming coals, their cozy bed of
blankets and balsam boughs awaiting them,
the two girls forgot the mysteries and adventures
of the day to sit and talk, as young people
will, of home, of friends, of hopes and
fears, and of the future that stretches on and
on before them like a golden pathway. They
were deep in this whispered revery when, gripping
her companion&rsquo;s arm, Greta exclaimed,
&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild, piercing, blood-curdling scream
had rent the air of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what can it be?&rdquo; As if for protection,
the slim girl threw herself into the arms
of her stout companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no loon!&rdquo; Florence measured her
words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some human being in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you!&rdquo; The slim girl shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should go to their aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just two girls! What could we do?
We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Florence touched Greta&rsquo;s lips.
From afar, as on that other night, there came,
wafted in faint and glorious tones, the whisper
of a violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you!&rdquo; Greta sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;That man playing the violin has nothing to
do with this other affair. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly,
or how could he play so divinely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t. He must be a friend of Percy
O&rsquo;Hara or he wouldn&rsquo;t have had his picture.
He is interested in others or he would not have
lowered that rope to me. We must hunt him
out and make him help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know it is a man? Why
not a girl, or two girls like ourselves?&rdquo; Greta
doubted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a man, just must be! Come!&rdquo;
Florence pulled her companion to her feet.
&ldquo;Come, we will follow the sound of the phantom
violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence led the way. It was strange, this
following a sound into the night. More than
once Greta found herself in the grip of an
almost irresistible desire to turn back; yet
always that cry of terror appeared to ring
in her ears and she whispered: &ldquo;We must!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>The trail they followed was one made by
wild creatures. And night is their time for being
abroad. Now as they pressed forward
they caught the sound of some wolf or lynx
sneaking away into the brush. Would they
always flee? Greta shuddered as she asked
the question.</p>
<p>From time to time they paused to listen
for those silver notes of the phantom violin.
&ldquo;Growing louder,&rdquo; Florence whispered on
each occasion.</p>
<p>Once, after they had remained motionless
for some time, she said with an air of certainty,
&ldquo;Comes from over the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after that they took a side trail and
began to climb. This path was steep, all but
straight up. More than once Greta caught
her breath sharply as her foot slipped. The
sturdy Florence struggled steadily upward
until with a deep sigh she exclaimed, &ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said no more. For a space of seconds
the violin had been silent. Now, as the music
burst once more upon their ears, it seemed all
but upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a little farther.&rdquo; The slender girl
gripped Florence&rsquo;s arm until it hurt.</p>
<p>Just then the moon went under a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Greta whispered in an awed tone.
&ldquo;Look! What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What indeed? Before them, just how far
away they could not tell, shone what appeared
to be innumerable pairs of eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green eyes,&rdquo; Greta whispered.</p>
<p>Next moment her voice rose in a note of
sheer terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! Florence! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer. Florence had vanished into the
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />AID FROM THE UNKNOWN</h2>
<p>As Greta called for the second time, &ldquo;Florence!
Florence! Where are you?&rdquo; an
answer came floating up to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Down below. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m coming up.&rdquo;
There was a suggestion of suppressed pain
in Florence&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Wait, you wait there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta had never found waiting easy. To
wait now, with a hundred green eyes focussed
upon her was all but impossible. And yet,
what more was to be done? Florence, having
fallen down the hillside in the dark, had taken
the flashlight with her. And the darkness all
about was intense. Without willing it, again
and again she fixed her eyes on those small
glowing orbs of green. &ldquo;If I only knew!&rdquo; she
whispered, and again, &ldquo;If I only did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>She heard her companion&rsquo;s panting breath
as she struggled up the uncertain slope.
&ldquo;Must be half way up,&rdquo; she whispered finally.</p>
<p>There came the sound of tumbling rocks.
&ldquo;She&mdash;she slipped!&rdquo; Catching her breath, she
waited. Yes, yes, she was climbing again.</p>
<p>And then as she was about to despair, a
bulk loomed beside her, a strong arm encircled
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greta,&rdquo; a voice whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sprained
my ankle; not too badly. The flashlight is
broken. We must try to find our way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours of groping and stumbling, with
many a fall; two hours of fighting vines and
brambles, then the dull glow of their burned
out campfire greeted their tired eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; Florence breathed. &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; And
to this girl at that hour the humble six-foot-square
tent, which they had set up that evening,
was just that&mdash;nothing less.</p>
<p>It was Florence who could not sleep that
night. The throbbing pain in the sprained
ankle defied repose. The strange events of
that day and those that had gone before had
at last broken through her staunch reserve
and entered her inner consciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; she exclaimed at last in a hoarse
whisper. &ldquo;Who can sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Strangely enough, at that moment in a little
cabin at Chippewa Harbor, Vincent
Stearns, the young newspaper photographer
who had given Greta the white flares, lay on
his cot looking away at the moon and wondering
in a vague sort of way what was happening
to his dark-eyed friend up there on Greenstone
Ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope she finds some rare greenstones,&rdquo; he
said to the moon. &ldquo;Hope she is finding adventure,
happy adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy adventure.&rdquo; He repeated the words
softly. &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s what we all hope to have
in life. But so few adventures are happy ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that little girl&rsquo;s adventures are not
happy ones, there will come the white flare
in the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The white flare.&rdquo; He found himself wishing
against the will of his better self that he
might catch the gleam of that white light
against the skyline. &ldquo;What an adventure!&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;Racing away to Lake Ritchie,
paddling like mad, then struggling up the
ridge in the night to find&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, what would he find? What did he
expect to find? He did not know. Yet something
seemed to tell him that perhaps at some
unearthly hour the flare would stand out
against the sky.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Adventure. Having given up thoughts of
sleep, Florence was going over in her mind
the events of that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hydroplane,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Who
can be coming up here to hide away on the
shore of that narrow lake? And why?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How simple it is after all, coming up here
in a plane without attracting attention! The
plane from Houghton comes and goes at all
hours. The people at Rock Harbor hear it.
If it does not land at their door, they say, &lsquo;It
has gone to Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor or Belle Isle.&rsquo;
The folks at Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor and Belle Isle
think it has gone to Rock Harbor. The strange
plane may come and go up here as its pilot
wishes, and no one the wiser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;we are not officers
of the law. It&rsquo;s really not our affair. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of the scream Greta had
heard, and of the apparently helpless one carried
to a boat and then to land, and after that
of the scream they had both heard in the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;all human life is
so precious that it is the duty of all to protect
those who are in danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably nothing very terrible,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;Nothing to be afraid of. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke her thoughts square off to lean
forward and listen with all her ears. Had she
caught some sound from without, the snapping
of a twig perhaps?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some prowling wolf or a moose passing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this, she opened the flaps
of the tent and peered into the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>The moon was high. The silence was uncanny.
Every object, trees, bushes, rocks
stood out like pictures in fairyland. Shadows
were deep wells of darkness.</p>
<p>Some ten feet from their tent was a large
flat rock, their &ldquo;table.&rdquo; This stood full in the
moonlight. That they had left nothing on this
&ldquo;table&rdquo; she knew right well. She had washed
it clean with a canvas bucket full of water
from a spring. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes to look again. No, she
was not mistaken. Two objects rested on that
rock, one white as snow, the other dark and
gleaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;have to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creeping from the warm blankets, she
stepped on the cold, damp floor of night.
&ldquo;Oo!&rdquo; she shuddered. Next instant her hands
closed on the mysterious objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how strange!&rdquo; She shuddered
again, but not from the cold, then beat a
hasty retreat.</p>
<p>Inside the tent, she turned the objects over
in her hands. One was a large roll of bandages,
the other a bottle of liniment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;who can that
have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer came to her instantly. &ldquo;The
one who lowered the rope into the copper
mine. And, perhaps, the one who plays the
violin so gloriously. And who is he?&rdquo; Here
was a question she could not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take, eat,&rsquo;&rdquo; she whispered the words of
a half forgotten poem.</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;Take, eat, he said, and be content.</p>

<p>At that she rubbed the liniment over her
swollen ankle vigorously, bound it tightly,
then crept beneath the blankets once more.</p>
<p>Though the bandage relieved her somewhat,
she was still conscious of pain. Our
waking thoughts as well as our dreams are
often inspired by physical sensations. Pain
awakens within us a longing for some spot
where we have known perfect peace. To Florence,
at the moment, this meant the deck of
the unfortunate <i>Pilgrim</i>. There, with the waves
lapping the old ship&rsquo;s sides, the gentle breezes
whispering and the gulls soaring high, she
had found peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>As she allowed her mind to drift back to
those blissful days, she was tempted to wish
that she and the slender, dark-eyed Greta at
her side had never set foot on Greenstone
Ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she whispered. The words of
some great prophet came to her. &ldquo;&lsquo;There is a
destiny that shapes our ends, rough-hew them
how we may.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was written in the stars that we should
be here,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;And, being here,
we shall do what we can for those who are
nearest us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, God willing, we shall go back. And
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the narrow camping
grounds on the shores of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay.
&ldquo;There is treasure hidden there,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;How can it be otherwise? It is the only
bit of level land on that side of Blake&rsquo;s Point.
Countless generations of men have camped
there. We will go back there and dig deep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And when I am weary of digging&mdash;&rdquo; she
laughed a low laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back and get
that monster of a pike. I&rsquo;ll go all by myself.
And will I land him? Just you wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow passed over her brow as she
thought of the head hunter. &ldquo;Terrible man!
Where can he be now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the strange black schooner
with a deep-sea diver on board. &ldquo;Some treasure
on that old ship. When I&rsquo;m back I&rsquo;ll try
diving to see what&rsquo;s there. Might be more important
than the wreckers, who stripped the
ship, knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we need,&rdquo; she whispered dreamily as
the drugging odor of balsam and the silence
of night crept over her, &ldquo;all we need is a barrel
of gold. One barrel of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish. She had fallen asleep.</p>

<br />A SONG FROM THE TREE TOPS</h2>
<p>Greta Clara Bronson was by nature
a musician, an artist, a person of
temperament. The dawn of another day found
her in no mood for seeking adventure. The
troubles of others, if indeed there were troubled
ones in these hills, seemed far away.</p>
<p>Having made sure that her companion&rsquo;s
sprained ankle was not a matter of serious
consequence, she found herself ready for a day
of rest and thought; not serious thought, but
the dreamy sort that leads one&rsquo;s mind, like a
drifting cobweb, into unknown lands.</p>
<p>All the long forenoon she lay upon a bed
of moss in the sun. At times she dreamed of
her home and mother. This seemed very far
away. Would she return to it all? Surely,
&ldquo;&lsquo;When the frost is on the pumpkin,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
whispered. Looking up at the sun, she smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>For an hour she dreamed of the wreck and
of the shady shores of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay. &ldquo;Dizzy,&rdquo;
she whispered, &ldquo;I wonder where he is?&rdquo; Before
leaving the wreck, they had set their pet
loon free. He seemed quite able to care for
himself. &ldquo;Probably he&rsquo;s gone ashore and has
laughed his head off at some crazy loon that
looks just like him,&rdquo; she chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeanne?&rdquo; Greta asked herself. &ldquo;Is she
truly happy with those queer gypsy people?
How strange it seems!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Yes, Jeanne was happy with &ldquo;those queer
people.&rdquo; Having, as of old, forgotten all
thought of the morrow, she had in true gypsy
fashion thrown herself with abandon into the
joys of each new day.</p>
<p>At Chippewa Harbor there were a few small
cabins and many tents. The visitors showered
silver down upon her tambourine when her
dance with the bear was over. &ldquo;Frank, joyous,
kindly people, these Americans,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;What a glorious land!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>And yet her keenest joy came when, after
climbing a ridge, she came at last upon a lake
three miles long, a mile wide, where there was
no one. &ldquo;Dark forests, darker water, wild
moose, wild birds and the deep, glorious silence
of God,&rdquo; she whispered to the companion
at her side. &ldquo;How grand to pitch a tent
on these shores and live many long days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the <i>Ship of Joy</i> made its way slowly along
the shores of Isle Royale, and still the dark-eyed
Greta sat far up on that ridge dreaming
the hours away.</p>
<p>After a lunch of toast, bacon and black tea,
Greta declared her intention of going out to
play for the birds.</p>
<p>Tucking her violin under her arm, she wandered
away up the ridge. At the summit,
somewhat to her surprise, she found a hard-beaten
trail. Traveling here with ease, she
wandered on and on until with a little start
she found herself recognizing a certain jagged
rock formation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been here before.&rdquo; She stopped
dead in her tracks. &ldquo;I have! Last night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Should she turn back? Where were the
green eyes?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green eyes do not shine in the day!&rdquo; She
laughed a little. &ldquo;Ghosts, witches, green eyes,
they all vanish at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seating herself on a moss covered rock, she
began thrumming the strings of her violin.
Then she sent out some little plaintive snatches
of song.</p>
<p>She paused to lean far forward, intent,
alert, expectant. Yes, there it was. A bird
had answered.</p>
<p>After listening with all her ears, she imitated
his call. Then she listened again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, my little one!&rdquo; Her heart
warmed to the tiny whistler of Greenstone
Ridge. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she repeated his song. This
time there were two replies, one near and one
far away. Soon it seemed the bushes, the
trees, the very air was filled with little gray
and brown songsters. Thrilled by this unique
experience, she forgot both time and place as
she proceeded to charm her tiny auditors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Place was brought back to her with startling
force. Some great creature came thrashing
through the brush.</p>
<p>With a low cry, she gripped her precious
violin and sprang for the nearest tree.</p>
<p>Just in time she was, for a bull moose
charged full upon the spot where she had been.
Why he charged will remain a mystery. Perhaps
he did not love music. Perhaps he was
just mean by nature. Enough that he was
here; and here, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
he meant to stay.</p>
<p>Having spent a full ten minutes sharpening
his jagged antlers on a dead cottonwood tree,
he marched up to Greta&rsquo;s fir tree, leaned his
full weight against it, then gave forth a most
terrifying roar. Finding the tree quite solid
and alive, he dropped with a grunt on the bed
of moss at the foot of the tree and pretended
at least to fall asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our next number,&rdquo; Greta said quite soberly,
&ldquo;will be a cradle song entitled &lsquo;When
father moose goes to sleep.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>The thing she played, perched there like a
nightingale on a limb, was not that at all, but
an exquisite fantasy written after some all-but-forgotten
folk song of the gypsies.</p>
<p>Caught by the charm of it, she played it
over and over.</p>
<p>Then, to her vast astonishment, as the notes
faded away and she rested there among the
branches, someone took up her song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A violin!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The phantom
violin! And so close at hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect, there in the gathering twilight,
was like a touch of magic.</p>
<p>The silence that followed the stranger&rsquo;s last
note was most profound, so perfect that the
flutter of a small bird&rsquo;s wings might be heard
ten yards away. Charmed by this little touch
of the dramatic in life, Greta forgot that she
was perched in a tree, that a monstrous moose
lay at the foot of that tree, and that darkness
was falling. Lips parted, ears strained, she
waited for one more note from that magic
violin.</p>
<p>It did not come. Instead she heard a pleasing
voice say, &ldquo;What are you doing up there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;There is a moose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh ho! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; There came a mellow
laugh. &ldquo;Some bluffing old moose has you
treed. Watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next instant an ear-splitting shout rent the
air.</p>
<p>Came a terrific thumping at the foot of her
tree, followed by a sound of crashing of bushes
that rapidly diminished in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; the voice said. &ldquo;Come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brief scramble, then she found herself
looking into a smiling face. The face was
framed by a tangled mass of gray hair; yet
the face was young. It was the face of the
picture in that little blank book Florence had
found in the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Per&mdash;Percy O&rsquo;Hara!&rdquo; Her lips could
scarcely frame the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; the man stepped back. &ldquo;How did
you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always known you, at&mdash;at least for a
very long time. But why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he smiled, a strange smile, &ldquo;that,
dear child, is a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A child,&rdquo; said Greta, &ldquo;likes to hear stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not enough,&rdquo; he laughed a low laugh,
&ldquo;that I have saved you from a wild and ferocious
beast who, joking aside, would have
slept right there all night? And must I tell
you a story besides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the girl soberly, &ldquo;you have
more to gain by telling the story than I have
by listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A frown gathered on his brow. She shuddered
in fear. Yet again the ready smile returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stories,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;must be told in
just the right setting. This is not the time.
Another day perhaps. Not now. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. His face took on a look
of horror. &ldquo;Wha&mdash;what was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up from the depths below, where darkness
was falling among the black fir trees, rising
like a siren, had come one long, piercing
scream.</p>
<p>Then silence and falling darkness settled
over them like a shroud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />THE WHITE FLARE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;That scream! What was it?&rdquo; The figure
of Percy O&rsquo;Hara had suddenly
grown tense. In the gathering darkness he
seemed cast in bronze.</p>
<p>To the slim girl who but the moment before
had thought of this marvelous violinist
as a phantom, the whole thing seemed unreal.
&ldquo;Have you never heard it before?&rdquo; she asked
with a voice that trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard that scream before?&rdquo; He stared at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it two nights ago. But that was
late, near midnight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are people
down below by a narrow lake. They come
and go in an airplane. There&rsquo;s a lodge of
some sort and a small rowboat. They carried
someone into the lodge, someone who was
helpless, crippled or bound. I could not tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know all this, you who have been here
so short a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that someone came and went over
there.&rdquo; He spoke slowly. &ldquo;But I&mdash;you see I&rsquo;ve
wanted to be alone. If you go about spying
on others you&rsquo;re likely to be found out yourself.
I did not hear the scream at midnight.
Sound asleep. But we must do something.
We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; The girl gripped his arm impulsively.
&ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s Florence! The white
flare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she spoke night shadows were banished
and every smallest shrub and bush stood
out as in the light of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We must go! It is
Florence. That is a signal, a sign of danger.
But&mdash;&rdquo; her tone changed, &ldquo;how could that be
a signal? I never told her about the white
flares. They were given to me as a signal to
be used in case of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A signal to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Vincent Stearns,&rdquo; she replied, her voice
all atremble. &ldquo;He will come. Something terrible
has happened! We must hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In just one moment. I will be back. Don&rsquo;t
go without me. I know a short trail. We&rsquo;ll
be there at once.&rdquo; Her new found friend disappeared
into the night.</p>
<p>At once the girl&rsquo;s mind was awhirl with
questions. So this was the phantom. Why had
this wonderful musician hidden himself away
here on Isle Royale? Had he committed some
grave crime? It was unthinkable. And yet,
why was he here? Would she ever know?</p>
<p>Then her thoughts took another turn. Who
had screamed? Why had Florence lighted the
white flare? Because of the scream? She
would hardly do that, and besides she did not
know of the flares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh why did we come here?&rdquo; Greta said
the words aloud.</p>
<p>Then turning instinctively, she looked to
see if Percy O&rsquo;Hara might have heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Percy O&rsquo;Hara was not to be seen. That
which met her gaze set her knees trembling
afresh. Once again she was looking into what
appeared to be a hundred pairs of green and
gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; She started violently.</p>
<p>Percy O&rsquo;Hara was at her side. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go
this way. Follow the ridge. I&rsquo;ll lead the way.&rdquo;
Without another word he marched straight
ahead, leaving her to follow on.</p>
<p>He walked unerringly as some wild creature
of the forest, straight to the small tent
beside the big flat rock.</p>
<p>They found Florence quite unharmed, but
in a state of great agitation. &ldquo;Oh, Greta!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. Then, catching sight of Percy
O&rsquo;Hara, broke short off to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; Greta panted.
&ldquo;This is Mr. O&rsquo;Hara. Tell me what happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing happened&mdash;that is, nothing much.
Did you hear that scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I heard it and came dashing from
the tent. My foot struck something and sent
it bounding into the fire. Before I could grab
it, there came a blinding white flare. I jumped
back just in time to save myself. And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Greta broke in, &ldquo;Vincent
Stearns will come all the way up the ridge
from&mdash;from wherever he is. He&mdash;he&rsquo;ll bring
others, like as not, to&mdash;to save us from some&mdash;something
terrible. Oh!&rdquo; she fairly wailed,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what one gets for keeping secrets! He
gave me those flares before we started. And
I&mdash;I never told you!&rdquo; Greta seemed ready for
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be a great deal worse,&rdquo; Percy
O&rsquo;Hara broke in. His tone was reassuring.
He seated himself comfortably on a mossy
rock. &ldquo;I think that scream really meant
trouble of some sort. It would seem to be our
duty to investigate. And when there&rsquo;s investigating
to be done there&rsquo;s safety in numbers.
I think we&rsquo;ll do well to await the arrival of
your friend. Perhaps someone will come with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; his tone changed and his
bright eyes gleamed in the firelight. &ldquo;Have I
been smelling bacon, coffee and all that these
days, or have I not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pure imagination!&rdquo; Florence laughed.
&ldquo;We live on nuts and berries.&rdquo; For all her
laughing denial, she set about the task of
sending delicious aromas drifting along the
slope of Greenstone Ridge.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;phantom&rsquo;s&rdquo; delight in the food set before
him could not have been denied. No
empty words of praise were his. For all that,
fingers that trembled ever so slightly, eyes
that smiled in a way one could not forget, told
Florence her skill as brewer of coffee and
broiler of bacon was appreciated fully.</p>
<p>When the simple meal had ended, with a
low fire of bright coals gleaming red on the
great flat rock, they settled themselves upon
cushions of moss to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for what?&rdquo; Greta asked herself. &ldquo;For
the coming of Vincent Stearns. And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could find an answer? Before her
mind&rsquo;s eye the seaplane once more soared aloft
to at last settle down upon that narrow lake.
She looked again upon those black waters,
saw the rowboat, the moving figures, the helpless
one being carried away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; she whispered. Then
again she seemed to hear that piercing scream.</p>
<p>All this occupied her alert mind only a few
short moments. Then her dark enquiring eyes
were upon the face of that man who sat staring
dreamily at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Percy O&rsquo;Hara!&rdquo; she whispered low. &ldquo;The
Phantom Violin! Why is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if feeling her eyes upon him, he turned
half about, favored her with a matchless smile,
opened his lips as if to speak, then seeming to
think better of it, turned his face once more
toward the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he was going to tell
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not speak. Instead he continued
to stare at the fire. She studied his face. Well
worth her study, that face. A rather handsome,
strong, sensitive face, an honest, kindly
face it was. She looked in vain for traces of
deep sorrow. They were not to be found. She
tried casting him in the role of a man fleeing
from justice. It could not be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Once again his eyes were upon her.</p>
<p>This time he took his violin from its case by
his side. Tucking it under his chin, he began
to play. The music that came to her ears did
not seem human. So fine, so all but silent was
it, yet so exquisitely beautiful, it might have
been the song of a bird on the wing, or angels
in heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed as the last faint note
died away, and again &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrapping the priceless instrument carefully,
he returned it to its case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;now the Phantom
will tell his story.&rdquo; Still he did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;he is wondering
what lies in the future for him, the immediate
future, when he goes down the hill to
that&mdash;that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at his fingers. Slim, delicate,
they were the fingers of a true artist. &ldquo;And
with these he will defend someone,&rdquo; she told
herself as a little thrill crept up her back.
&ldquo;How&mdash;how impossible that seems!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, great musicians are not cowards.&rdquo;
She was thinking of that celebrated
Polish patriot who, having played for the rich
and great of all lands, had put aside his music
when his country called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not tell us tonight,&rdquo; she assured
herself, &ldquo;The Phantom will not speak, perhaps
never at all. Secrets are our own. No
one has a right to pry into our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only once during that long wait did the
Phantom speak. Turning to Greta, he said,
&ldquo;Where are you staying on the island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta nodded at the small tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been living on the wreck of the
<i>Pilgrim</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wreck!&rdquo; His eyes shone. &ldquo;How wonderful!
Better than Greenstone Ridge. Only,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;people would come to see you
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And you will come?&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s tone
was eager.</p>
<p>Once again his eyes shone upon her. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he said quietly, &ldquo;I fancy I shall be doing just
that sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>It was a promise in answer to a prayer. The
girl could ask no more.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later there came the sound of
movement in the bushes some distance down
the ridge. This was followed by a loud, &ldquo;Yoo
Hoo!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />MUSICAL ENCHANTMENT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yoo Hoo! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; came from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Vincent Stearns!&rdquo; Greta sprang to her
feet.</p>
<p>She cast one wistful glance toward Percy
O&rsquo;Hara. He, too, was on the move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spell is broken,&rdquo; she told herself with
a sigh. &ldquo;His story will not be told, at least,
not now. Perhaps never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of importance has happened,&rdquo;
Greta said aloud to Vincent Stearns as he
came toiling up the slope. &ldquo;At least not to us.
It was just an accident. Florence fell over a
flare and kicked it into the fire. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fortunate accident I should say!&rdquo; Percy
O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s tone was full of meaning. &ldquo;Far
as we can tell, there&rsquo;s something going on
down there by that little lake that needs looking
into. And now we have reinforcements.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like an adventure.&rdquo; The young
newspaper photographer&rsquo;s face took on a look
of unwonted animation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn reporter
and get a scoop for my paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we have finished you may not be in
a mood for writing.&rdquo; Percy O&rsquo;Hara did not
smile as he said this.</p>
<p>In as few words as possible he told the little
they knew of the mysterious ones who came
and went in a hydroplane and who uttered unearthly
screams in the night. &ldquo;We might as
well get right down there and have the thing
over with at once,&rdquo; he added at the end. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like interfering any more than I like being
interfered with. It has been more than a
year since I went into voluntary exile up
here.&rdquo; He paused to look away at the forest
and distant waters all aglimmer with the light
of the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Voluntary exile,&rdquo; Greta thought, &ldquo;I wonder
why? Can it have been anything very
terrible that drove him into seclusion? He
does not appear to fear being taken back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thankful for the solitude,&rdquo; Percy
went on. &ldquo;But there are times when one has
no right to be left alone. Those people down
there appear to have forfeited that right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a light rifle,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Thought
I might use it sometimes to kill rabbits if
necessity demanded it. I&rsquo;ve never used it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a gun of a sort,&rdquo; Vincent added his
bit. &ldquo;I have a notion that persuasion is better
than firearms, though. What say we get going?
Young ladies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming along,&rdquo; Florence put in.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong as a man. I&rsquo;ll do my part if need
be, and Greta can be the nurse, in&mdash;in case&mdash;&rdquo;
She did not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re lame!&rdquo; Percy protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little. Some raven came along with
bandages and liniment.&rdquo; She smiled knowingly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just about got me fixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were away. It was strange, this
trooping away down the ridge, single file, in
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&mdash;weird!&rdquo; Greta whispered to her companion.
&ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pr&mdash;probably nothing.&rdquo; Florence was all
aquiver.</p>
<p>Working their way silently down the hillside,
they at last arrived on the lower plateau.
Here they came upon a well worn moose trail
that, they thought, must lead to the lake.</p>
<p>They were not mistaken. Before they
reached the shore they caught the sound of
splashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moose.&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s lips formed the word she
did not speak.</p>
<p>Looking across the lake, they caught a dull
glow of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that&rsquo;s the place.&rdquo; She could not
prevent her teeth from chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to follow round the lake.&rdquo; Percy
O&rsquo;Hara marched on as once more they took
up the trail leading to the mysterious unknown.</p>
<p>For a full half hour they moved silently
through the evergreen forest that skirted the
lake. The low plump-plump of feet on mossy
trail, the swish of branches, was all that broke
the silence, the deep silence of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>At last, quite suddenly, they came to a narrow
cleared space, and there at its back was
the house of mystery.</p>
<p>For a moment they stood there, the four of
them, Greta, Florence, Percy O&rsquo;Hara, and
Vincent Stearns, before a low structure that,
standing dark and threatening among the
black spruce trees and shadows of night,
seemed to dare them to move forward. With
her own eyes Greta had seen a helpless one
carried from a hydroplane to this place. Three
times with her own ears she had heard an unearthly
scream rise from this spot. And now,
now as the hour hand approached midnight
they stood there listening, breathing hard,
waiting. Waiting for what?</p>
<p>Not a sound save the low splash of a moose
feeding from the bottom of the lake reached
their ears. From the single window, small and
low, a dull light gleamed. The place seemed
asleep.</p>
<p>And yet, the instant Vincent tapped lightly
on the door a hand was on the latch. &ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo;
Greta took a step forward. &ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>The door was thrown open. A man, seeming
very tall and thin in that dull light, stood
before them. His voice when he spoke was
low, melodious, friendly, and quite disarming.
There was, too, a note of sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in! Have you lost your way? May
I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta at this moment recalled those startling
screams, and shuddered.</p>
<p>There was about the place an air of comfort.
A gasp of surprise escaped Greta&rsquo;s lips.
&ldquo;Chairs, couches, books, fireplace. Might be
the living-room of any home. And up here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve made a mistake?&rdquo; she whispered
to Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>The silence grew painful. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Percy
O&rsquo;Hara said at last, as if there had been no
silence. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t lose our way. In fact I
could not lose myself up here if I tried. I&rsquo;ve
lived on this ridge for more than a year. We
came&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; The tall man, whose hair was graying
about the temples, held up a hand. &ldquo;You
need not go on. I understand perfectly. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sorry you came. But since you are here,
you have a right to be told certain things.
Won&rsquo;t you be seated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew chairs to the fire, chairs with deep,
soft cushions. As she sank into one of these
Greta thought with a shudder how difficult it
would be to rise from such a chair in a hurry,
should necessity demand it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; their host began, &ldquo;I am considered a
rich man. In fact a company I control owns
more than half this island. This shelter rests
on my land. You have been camping, all of
you, on my land.&rdquo; He paused as if to permit
the words to sink in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is supposed,&rdquo; he went on at last, &ldquo;that
rich men are the privileged ones of earth.
Truth is they have few privileges. Here I am
at the heart of an all but deserted island, living
on my own land. I own every foot of land
within ten miles of this spot! And yet, when
I choose, I cannot be alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we hadn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; Greta whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Florence replied once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>At this juncture a very short chubby man
with an air of briskness about him entered the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; He rubbed his small hands together.
&ldquo;We have company, Percy O&rsquo;Hara, Vincent
Stearns, Greta Bronson and Florence Huyler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta started. How could this little man
know their names? She was to wonder still
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no notion, Mr. Van Zandt,&rdquo; the
little man said, turning to his tall companion,
&ldquo;how famous our company is! A successful
newspaper photographer, a very famous violinist,
not to speak of the lady violinist and
her friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the astonished group. &ldquo;Your
arrival has saved me the bother of hunting you
up&mdash;providing now I may count upon your
services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had the two girls found themselves
in so strange a position. They had come here
with the others to assist&mdash;assist in what?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Vincent half rose, then dropped back to his
place. Percy O&rsquo;Hara gripped the arms of his
chair. Only Florence appeared at ease, and it
was she who at last spoke. &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; she
replied evenly, &ldquo;that we shall be glad to render
any service possible to Doctor Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Greta stared, this time at Florence.
How could Florence know this man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the little man replied, not denying
his identity, &ldquo;I had hoped so. It is, however,
from your musical friends that I expect to secure
aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Van Zandt,&rdquo; he addressed the other
respectfully, &ldquo;have I your permission to inform
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pained expression passed over the man&rsquo;s
face as he nodded assent.</p>
<p>Next day, just as the shadows were beginning
to lengthen on the hillside, Greta found
herself joined in an undertaking the like of
which she had never before known. Her part
seemed as simple as the song of a bird who on
a branch far above her head warbled in his
own sweet way; yet she threw into it every
atom of her being.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Seated on a moss-covered rock a stone&rsquo;s
throw from the mysterious lodge, she tucked
her violin under her chin and played as she
had never done before. The tunes that crept
out from that evergreen forest, like songs
from the heart, were old as life itself, yet
known and loved by every generation. She
played one of those sweet, melodious songs of
twilight, written as only an inspired artist can
compose, then rested with bow poised, waiting.
From away on the hill across the narrow
lake the notes came back to her.</p>
<p>Not an echo, but the crystal clear notes of
a second violin, played as only one musician
could play them, Percy O&rsquo;Hara.</p>
<p>Once again she played the slow, dreamy refrain.
And, as before, it came drifting back
to her.</p>
<p>Inside the lodge Florence, listening, caught
the rise and fall of that song and thought it
must come from another world.</p>
<p>But strange events were passing. Before
her in a great cushioned chair sat a boy of
fourteen. His attractive face was as white as
death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think!&rdquo; The little doctor, looking into the
boy&rsquo;s face, spoke softly. &ldquo;Think, think back,
back, back. What frightens you? Why do you
cry out? Think back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward. Through the open window
floated the entrancing music. Florence,
understanding the meaning and the terrible
import of it all, scarcely breathed, yet her lips
moved in prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think!&rdquo; the doctor repeated. &ldquo;Think back.
Now you are twelve, skating, playing football,
wandering through the forest. Do you see
anything that terrifies you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are ten.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s words
came in a whisper. &ldquo;You are on roller skates.
You are at home by the fire. You speed in an
automobile. Are you terribly afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no answer. Still the music, now faint,
now strong, came floating through the open
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are six.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s eyes shone.
&ldquo;You are by the fireside. You are in your own
small room. It is night. Does&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Of a sudden there came a scream so piercing
that Florence leaped to her feet. It was the
boy. His face was distorted by an agony of
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What is it?&rdquo; The doctor was bending
over the boy. &ldquo;What frightens you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog!&rdquo; the boy cried. &ldquo;The big shaggy
dog! Don&rsquo;t let him in! He will bite me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! You are mistaken. That is a
kind dog. He will not bite you. He has never
harmed any one. You must learn to love the
good old shaggy fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lines of distortion began to disappear
from the boy&rsquo;s face. There was a question and
a gleam of hope in his eyes.</p>
<p>Through the window, borne on the breeze,
there floated the notes of a song,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Silent night, silent night,</p>
<p class="t0">Lovely and bright&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is kind,&rdquo; the boy murmured. &ldquo;He will
not bite.&rdquo; The look on his face was growing
peaceful. He leaned back in his chair and was
soon lost in quiet slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the doctor murmured low as
they tiptoed from the room, &ldquo;God, with our
help, is working a cure. Tomorrow we will
repeat this. By that time the demon of fear
will have left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was his scream we heard,&rdquo; Florence
said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his scream,&rdquo; the father of the boy,
the rich Mr. Van Zandt, replied. &ldquo;It is a form
of hysteria brought on by fright. He has suffered
long, and we have suffered with him. We
hoped this secluded spot might help. It did no
good. When the illusion came he was seized
with terror. He screamed. But now, thanks
to this good doctor and the mystery of music,
we may hope for a complete cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These cases,&rdquo; the doctor said, assuming a
professional air, &ldquo;are strange, but not uncommon.
At some time in the patient&rsquo;s past he
has been terribly frightened. His outer self
may have forgotten; his deep, inner self has
not. When conditions arise that suggest this
fright, it reoccurs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we can still his mind, then cause him to
think back, back, back to that time of great
fright, we may be able to reassure his inner
self, and the hysteria vanishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to banish this terrifying dog, who
in reality could not have been vicious at all,
then our work will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Greta some time later as she
sat in the boat near to the lodge, &ldquo;is one of the
strangest things I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our minds <i>are</i> strange,&rdquo; said Florence as
she rowed slowly toward the shore nearest
their home on the ridge. &ldquo;But that,&rdquo; she murmured
after a time, &ldquo;that which we witnessed
today is no less than musical enchantment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />THE LITTLE BLACK TRAMP</h2>
<p>It was evening of the following day. The
fire on that big flat rock burned brightly.
Florence and Greta sat sipping hot chocolate
from paper cups. For a full half hour, while
twilight faded into night, neither spoke.</p>
<p>It was Greta who broke the silence. &ldquo;Florence,&rdquo;
she said soberly, &ldquo;life is strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are on Greenstone Ridge,&rdquo; the
dark-eyed girl went on. &ldquo;We came here to
explore and to&mdash;to search out the secrets of
the phantom. We found the phantom. We
solved the mystery. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The phantom is more mysterious than before.&rdquo;
Florence smiled a dreamy smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Greta replied quickly, &ldquo;he is! And
perhaps we shall never delve more deeply into
this mystery. We have not seen him since
that night when, like knights of old, we
marched down upon that mysterious cabin by
the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have heard his music but have not
seen him, your strange Percy O&rsquo;Hara,&rdquo; Florence
said quietly.</p>
<p>This was exactly true. When the strange
little doctor had suggested that they assist
him in his marvelous cure of that boy afflicted
with mental terror, Percy O&rsquo;Hara had agreed
at once, but had suggested that Greta should
furnish the music close at hand and that his
should be little more than an echo. This arranged,
he had slipped away into the night.
Since then they had heard him twice, had
seen him not at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Greta whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; There came no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; she said, springing to her feet,
&ldquo;our work here is done. Doctor Prince has
told us that our assistance is no longer needed.
As for the phan&mdash;phantom, Percy O&rsquo;Hara,
we have no right to pry into his affairs. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d
like to go down to the camping ground by
Duncan&rsquo;s Bay.&rdquo; She seemed ready to weep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; Florence rose slowly to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The big girl began stuffing
things into her bag. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be away in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later two dark figures, guided
only by a flashlight, made their way over the
long moose trail leading along the ridge,
thence down to the shores of a dark and silent
bay. And all the time Greta was thinking of
Percy O&rsquo;Hara, who had charmed thousands
upon thousands with his matchless music, hiding
away there on the ridge. Once she whispered,
&ldquo;Green eyes, a hundred pairs of green
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they neared the shores of the bay, however,
her thoughts returned to her good friend
Jeanne and their home, the wreck of the old
<i>Pilgrim</i>. Once she whispered low, &ldquo;A barrel of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Had you chanced to look down upon that
narrow stretch of level land on the shores of
Duncan&rsquo;s Bay later that night, you might have
spied, hidden away in a shadowy corner, a
small tent. Beneath that tent two girls slept,
Florence and Greta. For them Greenstone
Ridge had become a memory.</p>
<p>They were up at dawn. Their boat, hidden
deep among some scrub spruce trees, awaited
them. So did a bright and shimmering lake.
And beyond this, dark and silent, was their
home, the wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Jeanne has come back,&rdquo; said Florence.
&ldquo;We will row over at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had covered half the distance to the
wreck and were watching eagerly for some
sign of life on its sloping decks, when Greta,
whose gaze had strayed away to the left, cried
out quite suddenly, &ldquo;Look, Florence! What
is that over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shading her eyes, Florence followed the
younger girl&rsquo;s gaze, then said with a slow tone
of assurance, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boat, a small black boat
adrift. Some ship, or perhaps only a schooner,
has lost her lifeboat. We&rsquo;ll take it in tow, tie
it up over at the wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>The small black boat was soon tied behind
their own. Florence&rsquo;s strong arms did double
duty as she covered the remaining distance to
the wreck.</p>
<p>Greta had climbed on board the wreck,
Florence had finished tying up her own boat
and was giving her attention to the small
black tramp, when she noted something of
mild interest. In the bottom of that boat was
water two or three inches deep, from a rain,
perhaps. Floating on the surface of that water
was a small square of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might give some clue,&rdquo; she thought as she
put out a hand.</p>
<p>Once she had spread the paper on the boat&rsquo;s
seat, her lips parted in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greta!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Greta! Come here. See
what I have found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Greta arrived all she saw was a sheet
of water-soaked paper. In the center of that
paper, done with a purple pencil, badly blurred
but still quite easily read, were four words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A BARREL OF GOLD.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that strange!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
&ldquo;Here we&rsquo;ve been dreaming in a silly sort of
way about a barrel of gold. And now, here it
is, all written out by a stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Jeanne wrote it,&rdquo; Greta suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t have. It&rsquo;s not her writing. And
look!&rdquo; Florence studied the paper more closely.
&ldquo;There are two lines drawn under those
words as if some other words had been crossed
out and these inserted. And that&mdash;&rdquo; she
straightened up, &ldquo;that is exactly what happened.
There are faint traces of pencil marks
all over the paper. The water has about
washed them away. Perhaps when the paper
is dry we can read the entire message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Placing the paper carefully on her outspread
hand, she carried it to the deck, then smoothed
it out on a board in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne is not here,&rdquo; Greta said quietly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not been here. Everything is just as we
left it, except&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except what?&rdquo; Florence stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure, but I think there are fresh
marks of a black schooner that has been tied
up alongside this wreck. Come and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be any doubt of it,&rdquo; Florence agreed
a few moments later. &ldquo;The black schooner, it&rsquo;s
been here again, Greta! Greta!&rdquo; She gripped
the slender girl&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Do you suppose there
could have been a barrel of gold hidden on
this wreck? And have they carried it away?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; she exploded, answering
her own question. &ldquo;There are three or four
barrels of oil in the hold. That was all they
left. Swen told us that, and he should know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />FATHER SUPERIOR TAKES A HAND</h2>
<p>The paper taken from the <i>Little Black
Tramp</i>, as Florence had named the derelict,
proved a disappointment. Though there
was still some suggestion of writing remaining
on its surface after it was dry, not one
word could be read. Only those four words,
brighter than ever, stood out clear and strong,
&ldquo;A BARREL OF GOLD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without the sprightly Jeanne about, the
wreck seemed a lonely place. &ldquo;What do you
say we row back to the camping ground and
dig for treasure?&rdquo; Florence suggested after
their midday siesta. &ldquo;We can stay all night if
the wind blows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig for treasure? Florence, you&rsquo;re still
thinking of that barrel of gold!&rdquo; Greta exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find it there. It&rsquo;s on this
old ship. You wait and see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>Greta was glad enough to go. She hoped,
for one thing, that she might catch again the
tuneful notes of that phantom violin. &ldquo;Shall
I ever know?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Why does
he hide away there on Greenstone Ridge? Percy
O&rsquo;Hara,&rdquo; she whispered. She closed her
eyes to see again that tangled mass of gray
hair, those frank, smiling young eyes. &ldquo;Percy
O&rsquo;Hara. How much good he could be doing!
How he can charm the world&rsquo;s cares away!
And how this poor old world needs that these
days!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he could help those who are struggling
up. He could teach&mdash;&rdquo; she dared not
continue, dared not hope that sometime, somewhere,
this matchless musician might take her
bow gently from her hand as he said with that
marvelous smile, &ldquo;No, my child. Not that way.
See! Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it might be!&rdquo; she sighed. Yes, she
wanted to go ashore, longed to climb all the
way up Greenstone Ridge. But this last she
was resolved never to do. &ldquo;He said he would
come,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He will not fail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>At ten that night Greta slept soundly beneath
the tent on the camping grounds. Having
listened in vain for the faintest tremor of
music on the air, she had surrendered at last
to the call of dreamland.</p>
<p>Florence, too, was beneath the blankets, but
she did not sleep. The strange discovery of
that day was still on her mind. &ldquo;Barrel of
gold,&rdquo; she repeated more than once.</p>
<p>Her treasure hunt that afternoon had been
singularly unsuccessful. She had not found so
much as a flint arrowhead or a copper penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big piece of nonsense!&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, having dragged on shoes,
knickers, and sweater, she was digging once
more on the camping ground, digging for
gold. Such are the strange, unfathomable
ways of youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>She had stirred up their campfire and was
digging with the aid of its light. As she labored
her sturdy figure cast odd, fantastic
shadows on the dark forest at her back.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At the same hour Jeanne returned to the
wreck. She came with her gypsy friends on
the <i>Ship of Joy</i>. For once in his life Bihari was
in a great rush. His journey round the island
had been completed. There was in the air
some deep prophecy of storm. Being one of
those who live their lives beneath the blue
dome of heaven, he felt rather than saw this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are here!&rdquo; Jeanne cried in great joy
as they neared the wreck of the old <i>Pilgrim</i>.
&ldquo;Florence and Greta are here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no light,&rdquo; someone protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are dreaming in some corner of the
ship, or perhaps they are asleep,&rdquo; Jeanne insisted.
&ldquo;They <i>must</i> be here, for&mdash;see! There
is their boat. We have but one boat. They
could not well be away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Climbing to the deck, the little French girl
bade her gypsy friends a fond farewell, then
from her favorite spot on the deck watched
the lights of Bihari&rsquo;s boat grow dim in the distance.
Then she set about the task of finding
her friends. This, as you know well enough,
was to be a hard task. They were not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>The explanation is simple enough. Having
tried out the <i>Little Black Tramp</i> and found it
easy to row, Florence had chosen to go ashore
in it and to leave her own boat tied up to the
wreck. So here it was and here was the little
French girl alone on the <i>Pilgrim</i>. It was night,
and she had not forgotten Bihari&rsquo;s warning:
&ldquo;There comes a great storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>On the camping ground, lighted by the
campfire&rsquo;s flickering glow, Florence dug steadily
on. &ldquo;Not that I expect to find anything,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wearing down my
mental resistance to sleep. Pretty soon I&rsquo;ll
drop this old spade and creep beneath the
blankets. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off. Strange sounds were
reaching her ears; at least they were strange
for this place. Music, the tones of a violin,
came to her. Clear and distinct they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be far,&rdquo; she told herself. She thought
of Percy O&rsquo;Hara, the &ldquo;Phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air&rsquo;s strange tonight,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s still away up there. Sound carries
a long way at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again her spade cut deep in the sand.
But now her heart skipped a beat. She had
struck some solid object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a rock or a log buried by a storm centuries
ago,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she
was digging fiercely now. Like a dog close to
a ground squirrel&rsquo;s nest, she made the dirt fly.</p>
<p>The thing she had found was not a rock.
&ldquo;Not hard enough for that,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;A log? Well, perhaps. But it&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ceased digging. Seizing a firebrand,
she fanned it into flame, then held it low in
the hole she had dug. Next instant she was
all but bowled over with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a barrel!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Or, at least
a keg. And it has heavy copper hoops. It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>But at this instant a light shone full upon
her face. It was there for only an instant, but
long enough to give her warning. Seizing her
spade, she had half filled the hole when a small
boat came around the point.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At that hour too there were strange doings
on the wreck. The mysterious black schooner
had returned. Only chance had prevented the
men on the schooner from seeing the light
that shone from Jeanne&rsquo;s cabin, to which she
had retired in uneasy solitude. They approached
the wreck from the other side.</p>
<p>The first suggestion of their presence came
to Jeanne as a slight bump ran through the
stout old hull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a boat!&rdquo; she breathed. Instantly her
light was out. A moment had not elapsed before,
wrapped in a long dark coat, she crept
out on the deck.</p>
<p>Once outside, she stood there, silent, intent,
ready to flee, listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chains,&rdquo; she whispered at last, &ldquo;I hear
them. That&rsquo;s what they had on that black
schooner that other night. They mean to lift
something with chains. I&rsquo;ll creep along the
deck to that box where life preservers were
kept. Have a look at these men from there.
They won&rsquo;t see me. I&rsquo;ll be in the shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crept along in the deep shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here&rsquo;s the place.&rdquo; She drew up behind
a large box painted white.</p>
<p>After a brief rest to quiet the wild beating
of her heart, she crept forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I can see them
plainly from here. There&rsquo;s the man in the diving
rig again. He is just going over the side.
Taking a chain with him. I can hear it rattle.
Chain&rsquo;s fast to a light cable. They&rsquo;re going to
try lifting something from below, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The diver disappeared beneath black waters.
Two other men stood at attention. The
girl held her breath and waited. She tried to
picture to herself the inside of the ship beneath
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cabins where people have slept. Fishes
swimming there and big old crawfish crawling
over the berths. Deck slippery with slime,
and the hold where all the freight was stored
dark as a dungeon. You&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish. From the distance had
come a strange sound. A rushing as of a
mighty wind. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no wind!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>The sound increased in volume until it was
like the roar of a storm. Then, of a sudden,
a great swell struck the ship. It set the old
wreck shuddering from stem to stern. It
picked up the black schooner and, tossing it
high, landed it half upon the dry deck of the
ship and half upon the water. It keeled over
on one side, reeled like a drunken man, seemed
about to turn square over, then sliding off the
deck, went gliding away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the diver?&rdquo; Once again the girl held
her breath.</p>
<p>After what seemed a very long time, a dark
spot appeared off to the right. The power
boat glided over. The dark spot was taken on
board.</p>
<p>Next moment a second swell shook the ship.
When this wave had subsided the power boat
was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Father Superior,&rdquo; the little
French girl exclaimed. &ldquo;He took a hand!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will they return?&rdquo; she asked herself. She
found no answer. A glance away to the left
caused her to shudder. Like an army of black
demons, clouds were massed low against the
sky. A faint flash of light painted them a lurid
hue. This was repeated three times. Then all
was darker than before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />PASSING OF THE <i>PILGRIM</i></h2>
<p>Florence had scarcely concealed the
newly discovered treasure before she
knew, from the shape of the oncoming boat,
that it was owned by a friend. In truth it was
Swen with his stout little fishing boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he shouted as the fire, flaring up,
revealed her face. &ldquo;I thought you were at
home on the wreck. I saw a light there. I
was sure of it. Had to come in there for some
nets I left on the shore, then I was going over
to see how you were getting on and to warn
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;there can&rsquo;t be a light
on the wreck. No one is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Swen&rsquo;s tone carried conviction.
&ldquo;There <i>was</i> a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;Jeanne has returned,
or&mdash;or someone else is there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Greta!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Greta! Wake up!
Someone is on the wreck. We must go there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave the tent as it is,&rdquo; she said five
minutes later as Greta, hastily dressed and
half asleep, stepped out in the air of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you over,&rdquo; Swen said. &ldquo;The sea
is roughing up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swen,&rdquo; Florence said as they went pop-popping
through the narrows, &ldquo;you said you
meant to warn us. Warn us of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably nothing.&rdquo; Swen seemed ill at
ease. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a storm&mdash;just a storm, that&rsquo;s
all. Two waves, like tidal waves, came near
swamping my boat. It&rsquo;s a sign, the fishermen
say. But then, we are superstitious. That&rsquo;s
it, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all that, when he had landed the girls
at the wreck and had made sure Jeanne, not
some stranger, was there, he turned his boat
about and steamed away at full speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to warn us,&rdquo; Florence whispered
to herself. Then a matter of overwhelming
interest drove all other thoughts from her
mind. She turned to the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Just think! I
found a barrel, a small barrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the camping ground?&rdquo; Jeanne leaped
to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and what was in it?&rdquo; Greta was fairly
dancing with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t time to see. It had copper
hoops, that&rsquo;s all I know. Swen came and then&mdash;then
we were away. I&mdash;I covered it up. It
won&rsquo;t run away,&rdquo; she laughed as Jeanne&rsquo;s face
sobered. &ldquo;It will keep for another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us go now, tonight!&rdquo; Jeanne was
quite beside herself with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not tonight,&rdquo; Florence said with an air
of decision. &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As things turned out it was to be tonight;
but this she could not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Some three hours later Florence stirred uneasily
in her sleep. It was a very dark night.
The cabin on the wrecked <i>Pilgrim</i> in which she
slept was a well of darkness. Yet there were
times when, for one brief second, every detail
of the cabin showed out in bold relief. The
over-ornamented walls, done in white and
gold, the narrow shelf where a small clock
ticked loudly, the rough table with two short
legs and two long ones to make up for the
slanting deck; all these could be seen plainly.
So too could the blond hair of her bunk-mate,
Jeanne, sleeping beside her in the berth where
for forty years only ship captains had slept.</p>
<p>The large girl stirred once again. One
brown arm stole from beneath the covers. The
hand seemed to reach for some object hung
in space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A barrel of gold.&rdquo; Her lips said the words
aloud. The sound of her own voice roused her
to a state of half-awakeness. &ldquo;A barrel of
gold,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>For some little time she lay there half
asleep, half awake.</p>
<p>Her sleep had been disturbed by certain
sounds, distant rumbles, rushes and swishes
of water; also by those vivid flashes of light.</p>
<p>A moment more and she sat bolt upright in
bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going to storm,&rdquo; she mumbled to herself,
without being greatly disturbed. It had
stormed before. Three times great, dark
clouds had come driving in across black waters
to engulf them. Each time the wrecked <i>Pilgrim</i>,
with her three last passengers on board, had
weathered the storm in as stalwart a manner
as any ship afloat on the sea.</p>
<p>For some time she sat there listening,
watching. As the flashes of light grew brighter,
more frequent, and the rumbles broke into
short, sharp crashes, she crept silently from
beneath the covers to draw on a heavy mackinaw,
then step out upon the deck.</p>
<p>At once a cold chill seized her. A flash of
lightning had revealed such a cloud as she had
not seen in all her life. Inky black, straight up
and down like a gigantic pillar, it appeared to
glide across waters that reflected its ink-blackness
and to grow&mdash;grow&mdash;grow as it advanced.</p>
<p>Stepping quickly back into the cabin, she
shook her companions into wakefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne! Greta! Wake up! It is going to
storm. Something rather terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>Instantly she went about the business of
lighting a flickering candle. Then she drew on
knickers and high boots.</p>
<p>Her mind was in a whirl, yet she managed
to maintain a certain degree of inner calm.</p>
<p>What was to be done? Here they were,
three girls on board a wreck with a storm that
promised unparalleled violence, sweeping
down upon them.</p>
<p>There was but one way of leaving the wreck.
They must go, if at all, in their sixteen-foot
rowboat&mdash;a mere nutshell in such a time as
this. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you dressed?&rdquo; she asked shakily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all dressed.&rdquo; Both Jeanne and Greta
appeared to be quite calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Throw what things you can into
your suitcase, then come on.&rdquo; She set the example
by tossing garments into a corner, then
cramming them into her bag.</p>
<p>Having thrust a flashlight into her pocket,
she led the way out into the night.</p>
<p>She was met by a gust of wind that all but
blew her off the deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look&mdash;look out!&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;Hang on
tight! Over here! The boat&rsquo;s over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To leave the ship at such a time as this
seemed madness. Yet there had come to her
a sense of guidance. In times of great crises
she had more than once experienced just this.
Now she moved like one directed by a master
hand.</p>
<p>The water appeared blacker now. The
flashes of light were vivid beyond belief. The
swells were coming in. Great sweeping
swells, they lifted the little rowboat, tied on
the lee side of the wreck, to a prodigious
height, then dropped it into a well of darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop&mdash;drop your bag into the boat when
it comes&mdash;comes up.&rdquo; Wind seemed to fill the
girl&rsquo;s ears. It caught her words and cast them
away.</p>
<p>Down went the bags, and with them the
boat.</p>
<p>One, two, three, up surged the boat again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Over you go!&rdquo; Seizing Greta, she
fairly threw her into the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>Her heart sank with the boat. It rose with
it as well. Jeanne was next. A moment more
and she was over the side, clinging to the seat,
cutting the rope, seizing the oars, then shoving
off, all in one wild breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll keep&mdash;keep our stern to the
storm!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Head in toward Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay. Some sandy beaches there. Mi&mdash;might
land. Mi&mdash;&rdquo; The wind blew the words
from her throat.</p>
<p>The cove that forms an approach to Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay is shaped like the top of an hourglass.
At the seaward side it is a mile wide. At
the land side it is tapered to a narrow channel.
By great good fortune the wind was shoreward
and slightly toward the entrance of Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay. The big girl&rsquo;s hope was to work
her boat back into this cove where, more and
more protected by the reef, she might find
calmer water.</p>
<p>To ride a great storm in a rowboat is always
thrilling, but not certainly too dangerous. If
the waves are long and high, you may ride
to their crest, glide down the other side, then
rise again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>Pulling with all her might, the stout young
oarsman held her boat&rsquo;s stern to the gale.
They rose. They fell. They rose again, this
time in the midst of hissing foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&mdash;this is going to be worth telling,&rdquo;
she shrieked. &ldquo;If we live to tell it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think we will,&rdquo; she whispered
to herself.</p>
<p>Now and again sharp flashes of lightning
revealed their position. They were working
back into the cove. But each moment the
storm grew wilder. The wind fairly shrieked
in their ears. Their hair flew out wildly. Some
sea bird, seeking shelter, shot past them at a
wild speed.</p>
<p>Clinging to one another, Jeanne and Greta
sat in the stern. As Greta watched that onrushing
pillar of cloud, she was all but overcome
by the conviction that never again would
they romp upon the deck of the ill-fated ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have known such joy there!&rdquo; she
told herself with a low sob. &ldquo;Our swimming
pool, long, lazy hours in the sun, songs at sunset.
When shall we know such joys again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>Then a strange question crept into her mind.
What was it the men on the black schooner
had sought on the wreck?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it was,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;they
will never find it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, could she be sure of this? Moments,
not hours, would tell.</p>
<p>Then the storm broke. A vivid flash revealed
the dark column. It appeared to hover
over the <i>Pilgrim</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Greta covered her eyes.</p>
<p>Florence still stared straight away and continued
to row. This was no time for flinching.
She saw the battered wreck rise high in air.
After that came moments of intense darkness,
such darkness as seems solid, like a black wall
at the dead of night.</p>
<p>When at last the blackness lifted, a flash of
light showed the pillar of cloud far away and
on the reef&mdash;not a sign of the ill-fated ship, the
<i>Pilgrim</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jeanne cried, pointing away in the
other direction. &ldquo;Look over there! A light!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>There could be no mistaking it. Off toward
the entrance to Duncan&rsquo;s Harbor was a swaying
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boat. Some sort of a boat. We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
try to head that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship,&rdquo; Florence said soberly a moment
later, &ldquo;is gone! It was like an arm, that cloud,
a great black arm reaching down and picking
it up. I saw it. A waterspout, I suppose they&rsquo;d
call it. We&mdash;we were saved by God&rsquo;s guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time later they found themselves
approaching a small power boat that, tossing
about over the waves, moved cautiously
nearer.</p>
<p>To their great joy they found this to be
Swen, and with him was Vincent Stearns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave you,&rdquo; Swen said a
trifle shamefacedly, once he had them on
board and well within the narrows. &ldquo;I was
afraid. But when I saw that cloud, when I
knew what was sure to happen, I got Vincent
to come with me. Now here we are, and, thank
God, you are safe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; It was Greta who held up a hand
for silence as they passed out of the narrows.
Music had reached her ears, wild, delirious
music, such as one may produce only at the
end of a terrific storm.</p>
<p>The storm was over&mdash;there could be no
questioning that. The moon was out in all its
glory. And there, his gray hair glistening in
that light, standing before their tent on the
camping ground, was the Phantom, Percy
O&rsquo;Hara. He was playing as perhaps he had
never played before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Greta whispered, &ldquo;I have found him.
I shall never lose him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, you might say, was strange. At
this dramatic moment she was thinking to herself,
&ldquo;A barrel, a copper-bound barrel. A barrel
of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br />GREEN-EYED MANSION</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A Barrel of gold!&rdquo; Florence cried as
the music ceased and she sprang
ashore. &ldquo;Come on! A copper-bound barrel!
A barrel of gold!&rdquo; She was able to keep her
secret no longer.</p>
<p>Forgetting all else, Jeanne, Swen and Vincent
followed her. Not so Greta. She had
found her mysterious friend once more. She
would throw discretion and all conventions to
the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you will tell me?&rdquo; She hurried up
to the musician smiling there in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, my sweet little girl, if it will
bring you joy I will tell you my secret which,
after all&mdash;&rdquo; he motioned her to a seat on a log
by the fire. &ldquo;Which, after all, is truly no secret
at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Being famous,&rdquo; he said, smiling in a
strange way, &ldquo;is not all that men think it.
To hear people say, &lsquo;Here he comes! There
he goes!&rsquo; and to know they mean you, to be
stared at all day long! Who could wish for
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you charmed them with your music,&rdquo;
Greta said in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;that was not so bad. To
stand before thousands, to know that you are
truly bringing joy to their lives, that is grand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even that&mdash;&rdquo; his voice took on a weary
note. &ldquo;Even that loses its charm when you are
weary and they still say, &lsquo;Play for us. Play
here. Play there.&rsquo; Then you long to be away
from it all, to forget, and to make a fresh
start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he added, smiling down at her,
&ldquo;so I ran away to Greenstone Ridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing&mdash;&rdquo; his tone became more
deeply serious. &ldquo;I wanted to create a little
music of my own, all my own. I suppose the
desire to create is in the heart of all. Up there
alone on Greenstone Ridge I wrote music. I
played it to the birds, the wolves, the moose,
but mainly to the twittering birds. You have
heard some of it. How&mdash;how do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Greta whispered, &ldquo;that it is divine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo; Greta&rsquo;s tone was wistful.
&ldquo;Now you will come back and you will play
again! And you will teach others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; There was a touch of tenderness in
his voice. &ldquo;Yes, dear little girl, I will go back
now. I will teach others, and you shall be my
very first pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;How&mdash;how marvelous!
But&mdash;&rdquo; her voice sank to a whisper.
&ldquo;We&mdash;we are not rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich? Who spoke of money?&rdquo; Once more
he beamed down upon her. &ldquo;No true artist
wants money from his disciples. All he asks
is that his pupils have the touch divine. And
that, my child, is yours. It is your very great
gift.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>For a time there was silence beside the
campfire. That silence was broken by a shout
of laughter. It came from the party of treasure
hunters. Florence&rsquo;s barrel had been
dragged from its sandy hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just break in the head with the spade,&rdquo;
she said as it lay on its side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Vincent Stearns took the spade
from her. Setting the barrel on end, he rubbed
the sand away to find a wooden cork. With
the heavy handle of his hunting knife he drove
this in, and at once a pungent odor filled the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum!&rdquo; said Vincent. &ldquo;Very old rum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not gold?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s hopes fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just rum,&rdquo; the photographer repeated.
&ldquo;Some trader buried it years ago. Poor fellow!
He never came back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll pour it out.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s hand was
on the small barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Once again
Vincent intervened. &ldquo;They say old rum is very
good for colds. That right, Swen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is, in the winter.&rdquo; Swen smiled
broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to Swen and me,&rdquo; Vincent suggested.
And so it was left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But those green eyes I saw up on the
ridge,&rdquo; Greta was saying to Percy O&rsquo;Hara. &ldquo;I
saw them twice. They were horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Percy O&rsquo;Hara chuckled, &ldquo;was the
light from my green-eyed mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he laughed again, &ldquo;I found a
great many greenstones on the ridge. One
day I got a grinding wheel from Swen&rsquo;s little
store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left money for it. I polished the stones
and set them in some soft sort of rock for tiny
windows to the crude cabin I built. When my
lamp was lit they shone out green in the
night, those eyes to my green-eyed mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A green-eyed mansion on the ridge of Isle
Royale,&rdquo; Greta said in a low tone. &ldquo;Perhaps
some day the whole world will learn of it and
make a pilgrimage to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; said Percy O&rsquo;Hara fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br />TREASURE AT LAST</h2>
<p>Vincent Stearns and Percy O&rsquo;Hara
bade their young friends farewell at
dawn. With Swen they went gliding away
toward Rock Harbor Lodge. They would wait
the coming of a passing steamer that would
carry them home.</p>
<p>When the chill damp of morning was gone,
the three girls spread blankets on the sand
and fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon when they sat down
to the first meal of the day. It was a regal
feast, for Swen had left two large, juicy steaks,
and Vincent had contributed a large box of
chocolates.</p>
<p>While they were in the midst of this repast
there came from the bay a piercing scream.
It was followed by a most ludicrous laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence, jumping up, &ldquo;is
old Dizzy, the dear, crazy old loon! He survived
the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw him a large piece of fresh meat.
After swallowing it at a gulp, he favored her
with one more burst of laughter, then went
splashing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said as she resumed her
place, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got a few days left here? I, for
one, am through with mysteries. I&rsquo;m all for
having a hilarious good time&mdash;boating, swimming,
fishing, hiking, and never a care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This program was carried out until quite
suddenly out of a clear sky mystery once more
caught them. Nor will any of them live to
regret it.</p>
<p>It all came about because Florence suggested
that they row out to the reef where the
unlucky <i>Pilgrim</i> had gone aground.</p>
<p>To them the reef was a mournful sight.
Nothing appeared above the placid surface.
A little way down on the jagged rocks were
the boilers and engines of the <i>Pilgrim</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And look!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;Barrels
down there. Three barrels. Not very far down
either. Barrels of oil, Swen said they were.
Must have shaken out of the hull, like peas
out of a pod. But barrels of oil. You&rsquo;d think
they might be worth something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a flash, a thought came to her.
&ldquo;That man on the schooner, the diver, what
was he after? Could it be&mdash;?&rdquo; She dared not
trust herself to think further. Swen was coming
that night with supplies. She would tell
him about the barrels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Swen agreed at once when he had
been told of the discovery, &ldquo;those barrels of
oil are worth quite a little. If it&rsquo;s linseed oil
they&rsquo;d be worth fifty dollars apiece. Lubricating
oil is cheaper, but would be worth going
after. Dive down and put on grappling
hooks. Drag them up on the reef. That should
be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
&lsquo;three last passengers&rsquo; and castaways. Now
we are about to turn wreckers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>And wreckers they were. They found it an
easy task to attach the grappling irons, then
with a cable attached to Swen&rsquo;s small power
boat to drag the first two barrels to the dry
surface of the jagged reef.</p>
<p>The third barrel presented difficulties. It
appeared unusually heavy. Twice the hooks
slipped off. The third time the capstan on the
boat gave way. But in time this third barrel
lay beside its two companions on the reef,
well above water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; Swen exulted. &ldquo;A fine
day&rsquo;s work! We&rsquo;ll just tie up and have a
look.&rdquo; He nosed the boat inshore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted a short time later. &ldquo;Two
barrels of lubricating oil. Not so good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?
This third barrel has rubbed against the rock
until it got a hole in its side. No oil in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment Florence caught sight
of something that set her heart racing&mdash;a
glint of gold from that hole in the barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sw-wen!&rdquo; she said shakily. &ldquo;Just help me
roll that barrel over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What?&rdquo; Swen complied, and as he
did so a golden coin rolled from the hole in
the barrel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A barrel of gold!&rdquo; Florence sat down suddenly.
She sat in a puddle of water on the
concave side of a rock and did not know it.</p>
<p>A barrel of gold it was&mdash;no less. The head
of the steel barrel had been removed. A great
number of gold coins, wrapped in paper, had
been packed inside, then the head had been
sealed up by steel welding. When the barrel
had been painted it looked just like any other.</p>
<p>Three hours later when the little fishing
boat pulled away she carried a considerable
treasure all in gold coins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Swen warned, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not our
gold. But there&rsquo;s something in it for us all
the same. Salvage, I guess you would call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mystery of that barrel of gold was not
solved at once. Little by little it became
known that a very rich and stubborn man had
refused to give up his hoarded gold when the
United States Government, for the good of
all its people, demanded that he should.
Thinking to evade the law, he had packed his
gold in a metal barrel and had attempted to
ship it to Canada, and, as we know, had failed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>Just who the men were on the schooner,
with the diver on board, will probably never
be revealed. Were they hired by the rich man
to retrieve the treasure? Were they plain
thieves who, having got some knowledge of
the gold, proposed to take it for themselves?
Who can say?</p>
<p>Before the girls left the island a rumor was
set afloat that there were bears to be found on
the island. It was traced to the mainland. It
was discovered there that a certain man of
doubtful character had started the rumor. As
proof of his story he displayed scratched
hands and tattered clothing. He had met the
bear, he said, by the old lighthouse at the end
of Rock Harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Jeanne laughed, &ldquo;must have been
the head hunter. It was my bear he met. I&rsquo;m
glad, though,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that he escaped
with his life. It is too terrible to die. The
bear punished him quite enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three girls were back in their city
homes when the salvage on their barrel of
gold arrived. Finding it to be quite a tidy
sum, they promptly divided it in two parts and
sent one part to Swen to be used for the best
interests of his fisherfolk. That which remained
they placed in the bank, a treasure
hoard to be spent, in part at least, on some
further adventure. If you care to know what
those adventures might be you are invited to
read the book called <i>Gypsy Flight</i>.</p>
